# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "My research in the past has focussed on variation in human height. In particular, how evolutionary processes have been and are shaping variation in stature. I tried to address questions like: Why is there such variation across countries in height? Why are women on average shorter than man? In what ways does height play a role in mate choice and competition? Does natural selection act on height in contemporary populations? Why are the Dutch so tall? Why am I so tall?"

I have published quite a bit on height (see also the list of publications). The one reference to rule all (my) other height publications is:

> Stulp, G. & Barrett, L. (2016). Evolutionary perspectives on human height variation. Biological Reviews 91(1): 206-234.

Also, I will not publish on the topic again. I have had enough.
