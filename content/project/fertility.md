I should still write something more sensible here. For now:

#### In medicine:

- _fertility_ - the ability to conceive children
- _fecundity_ - the ability to produce an abundance of offspring

#### In demography:

- _fertility_ - the number of live births of babies to that female
- _fecundity_ - the physiological ability to have children
