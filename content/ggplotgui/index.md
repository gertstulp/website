Visualisation is perhaps the easiest way to get good insights into the data at hand; whether for yourself or for the scrutinty of others. Disappointingly, most graphs in scientific papers do not attempt to show the (raw) data, but instead some summary measures (e.g., a bar plot of means). This hinders the scientific process. 

**R** may be most useful for creating good visualistations, but it can be daunting to use, particularly at the beginning. This is why I have made an **R-**-package `ggplotgui` that let's you create graphs using a Graphical User Interface. The important bit is that it also provides you with the code for generating the graph in **R** thereby hopefully facilitating the transition to **R**.  You can also use it online without having to install **R**. For further information, please go [here](https://github.com/gertstulp/ggplotgui).

To see the `ggplotgui` in action without using **R** click [here](https://site.shinyserver.dck.gmw.rug.nl/ggplotgui/) or see the screen below:
