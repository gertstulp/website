abstract = "Research on talent and performance development has primarily focused on inter-individual differences. However, research suggests that performance and the underlying determinants change over time, in an individual-specific dynamic way. This chapter illustrates a method to measure, understand, and visualize the performance- and psychosocial dynamics of a talented adolescent athlete. During one season, a talented tennis player filled out an online diary questionnaire twice a week. We visualized the results using R-scripts that we made openly available. This facilitated the interpretation of  the athlete’s performance- and psychosocial dynamics, and how these are influenced by particular events in the athlete’s life. "
