abstract = "Media reports often emphasize how the height of US presidential candidates plays an important role in election outcomes, with taller candidates winning an overwhelming number of elections across time. These claims are, however, rarely backed up by any form of reliable statistical analysis. Even when statistical methods are employed, they are often inadequate to the task. This case study discusses how to analyse presidential candidate height in relation to election success, showing how to calculate probabilities by hand, how to conduct a binomial test and how to perform randomization tests."
