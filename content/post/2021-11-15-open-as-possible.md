On October 27th, the Young Academy Groningen, in collaboration with the Open Science Community Groningen and de Digital Competence Centers at our University organised a hackaton-style-event. The aim of the event was to produce a as-short-as-possible-as-long-as-necessary decision tree to help researchers navigate requirements from the GDPR and Open Science. Vera Heininga and Toon Kuppens were essential in all this. 

The outcome of that event was presented at the official launch of the [Groningen Digital Competence Center](https://www.rug.nl/digital-competence-centre/calendar/2021/gdcc-official-launch). Slides can be found [here](/pdf/2021_YAG_OSCG_DCC.pdf). The preliminary-rough-draft decision tree, can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/rug.nl/gdpr/home).
