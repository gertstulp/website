<p>Recently on twitter I saw this idea that if you would pick a number from a uniform distribution [0, 1] and repeat drawing numbers until the sum of the numbers is lager than one, you’ll on average pick <strong>e</strong> numbers. Didn’t doubt it at all, just thought it would be fun checking this theory (theorem?) in <strong>R</strong>:</p>
<p>Let’s build a function that can test this. We’ll do it one million times, and then calculate the mean (that should be equal to <strong>e</strong>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>test_theory &lt;- function(no_tests = 10) {
  results &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;integer&quot;, length = no_tests)
  
  for(i in 1:no_tests) {
    sum = 0
    cnt = 0
    while(sum &lt;= 1) {
      sum = sum + runif(1, min = 0, max = 1)
      cnt = cnt + 1
    }
    results[i] = cnt
  }
  return(mean(results))
}
test_theory(1000000)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2.716295</code></pre>
<p><strong>e</strong> in <strong>R</strong> is 2.7182818</p>
