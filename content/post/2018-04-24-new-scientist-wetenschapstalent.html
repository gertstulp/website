<p>I am fortunate enough to have been nominated for the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/news/2018/04/socioloog-gert-stulp-genomineerd-voor-new-scientist-wetenschapstalent-2018">New Scientist Wetenschapstalent 2018</a>. The ‘winner’ will be determined by a committee and by popular vote (how scientific!). You can vote <a href="newscientist.nl/talent">here</a> if you think my research is good, or if you think I am not half-bad as a researcher.</p>
<p>For a quick Dutch video of my research, see:</p>
