<h3>beautiful-jekyll &amp; blogdown.</h3>
<p>I love the beautiful-jekyll website made by <a href="https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll">Dean Attali</a>. However, most of the stuff I want to blog about are about <strong>R</strong>, and visualisations in <strong>R</strong>, which is more easily done in RMarkdown than in Markdown. With the original jekyll theme and Github pages, transforming from an Rmarkdown to a Markdown file that is styled appropriately according to the beautiful-jekyll theme is a painfull process (for me at least!). This is why I have converted to <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="http://halogenica.net/">somebody</a> already made a beautiful-jekyll <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/">Hugo-theme</a> that is handy for blogdown. If you have installed the blogdown package already, you can simply do:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(blogdown)
blogdown::new_site(theme = &quot;halogenica/beautifulhugo&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I did run into some problems when doing it this way, though, which perhaps mostly relate to my limited experience with Hugo, blogdown, and making websites. How I got this website to work, was by first of all finding Emily Riederer’s <a href="https://emilyriederer.netlify.com/">website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/emilyriederer/emilyriederer">Github</a>. I copied her files into my blogdown-Rstudio-folder and adapted them. Setting up the netlify account was easy. <a href="https://gertstulp.netlify.com/">This</a> is my (new) webite.</p>

<h3>Outstanding issues</h3>
<p>I currently struggling with the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t quite understand what the <code>_index.md</code> file is doing, and more so, why it seems required. I tried to change it to a <code>index.md</code> file, but then the website crashes. I am sure that some theme documents expect the file. I want to change it because I don’t want the “blogs” to be present on the very first page. It probably means I have to dig a bit deeper into all the CSS and html-things. I did get this to work on my older <a href="https://gertstulp.github.io/">website</a> using the jekyll theme and Github pages</li>
<li>I want more of these circle-thingies in the footer. There are currently ‘only’ four. I want to add the scholar google and researcher orchid one. This will involve some html-additions. I remember I also fixed this for my older website, but obviously I don’t remember. I also don’t want the RSS-feed thingy.</li>
<li>Check how I can add pdfs to the website.</li>
</ul>
