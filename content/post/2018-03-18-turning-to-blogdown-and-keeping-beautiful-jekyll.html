<h3>beautiful-jekyll</h3>
<p>I love the beautiful-jekyll website made by Dean Attali <a href="https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll" class="uri">https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll</a>. However, most of the stuff I want to blog about are about R, and visualisations in R. Transforming from an Rmarkdown to a Markdown file to the website on github is a painfull process (for me at least!). This is why I will convert to blogdown (by Yihui). Yet I need to figure out how to get some of the beautiful-jekyll themed elements to the new blogdown website.</p>
<p>These are some useful websites: <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown" class="uri">https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown</a> <a href="https://github.com/ColinFay/jekyllthat" class="uri">https://github.com/ColinFay/jekyllthat</a> <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-and-jekyll/" class="uri">https://www.r-bloggers.com/blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-and-jekyll/</a></p>
