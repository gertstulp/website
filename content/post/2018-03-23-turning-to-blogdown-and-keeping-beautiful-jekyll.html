<p>So. In a relatively short time frame, I went from beautiful-jekyll Github-pages to bookdown-beautiful-jekyll to bookdown-academic-hugo. Here I’ll explain why. This actually is more me testing the blog.</p>
<div id="beautiful-jekyll-blogdown." class="section level3">
<h3>beautiful-jekyll &amp; blogdown.</h3>
<p>I love the beautiful-jekyll website made by <a href="https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll">Dean Attali</a>. However, most of the stuff I want to blog about involves <strong>R</strong> and visualisations in <strong>R</strong>, which is more easily done in RMarkdown than in Markdown. With the original jekyll theme and Github pages, transforming from an Rmarkdown to a Markdown file that is styled appropriately according to the beautiful-jekyll theme is a painful process (for me at least!). This is why I have converted to <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> (you can see my old website <a href="https://gertstulp.github.io/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="http://halogenica.net/">somebody</a> already made a beautiful-jekyll <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/">Hugo-theme</a> that is handy for blogdown. If you have installed the blogdown package already, you can simply do:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(blogdown)
blogdown::new_site(theme = &quot;halogenica/beautifulhugo&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I did run into some problems when doing it this way, though, which perhaps mostly relate to my limited experience with Hugo, blogdown, and making websites. How I got this website to work, was by first of all finding Emily Riederer’s <a href="https://emilyriederer.netlify.com/">website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/emilyriederer/emilyriederer">Github</a>. I copied her files into my blogdown-Rstudio-folder and adapted them. Setting up the netlify account was easy.</p>

<div id="beautiful-hugo-letting-me-down-or-me-letting-beautiful-hugo-down" class="section level3">
<h3>beautiful hugo letting me down (or me letting beautiful hugo down)</h3>
<p>Immediately I ran into some problems with the beautiful hugo website (this mostly relates to my inexperience with CSS and html-code). For instance, with much effort I was able to include more “academicons” (e.g., google scholar, orchid) to the original beautiful jekyll page, but I was not able to do so in beautiful hugo. After many hours of searching and testing and disappointing myself, I gave up.</p>
</div>
<div id="enter-hugo-academic" class="section level3">
<h3>Enter hugo-academic</h3>
<p>My next strategy was to go for the hugo-academic theme. Although I quite like it, I did prefer beautiful-hugo over hugo-academic. Until I saw <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/">Alison Presmanes Hill’s amazing website</a>. I just copied all the contents of the website from her Github-page, and started changing it. I am really chuffed with it. There are still many elements of Alison in this website, that I want to keep so I can learn how to do cool stuff. Over time, this will become less and less.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<div id="outstanding-issues" class="section level3">
<h3>Outstanding issues</h3>
<p>One drawback of using a massively styled theme, is that it is a bit more difficult to see how everything works. Also, there might be some bits that I would like to change in the future, but then maybe cannot because of the overall theme (“lock-in”). Some current “troubles”:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Getting my publication list ready seems a somewhat daunting task due to the way they are displayed on the main page, and due to the fact that each publication needs its own file.</p></li>
<li><p>Because I wanted more options in the top row, I have made subheadings. The disadvantage is that this menu “gets stuck” in mobile phone use</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/">This</a> and <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~k2smith/post/getting-started/">this</a> website is useful for academic hugo related stuff.</p></li>
</ul>
