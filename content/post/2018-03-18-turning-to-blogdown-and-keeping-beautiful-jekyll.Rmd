### beautiful-jekyll
I love the beautiful-jekyll website made by Dean Attali [https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). However, most of the stuff I want to blog about are about R, and visualisations in R. Transforming from an Rmarkdown to a Markdown file to the website on github is a painfull process (for me at least!). This is why I will convert to blogdown (by Yihui). Yet I need to figure out how to get some of the beautiful-jekyll themed elements to the new blogdown website. 

These are some useful websites:
