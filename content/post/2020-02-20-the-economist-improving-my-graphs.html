<p>Given the upcoming US elections, several media outlets have shown interest in my research on <a href="https://www.gertstulp.com/publication/2013_stulp_et_al_tlq_presidents/">US presidential height</a>. So did The Economist: <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/02/19/in-politics-height-matters" class="uri">https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/02/19/in-politics-height-matters</a>.</p>
<p>They definitely improved my graphs: <img src="/img/president1.png" /></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/president2.png" />

</div>
<p>I should try and see if I can recreate those graphs in <strong>R</strong>.</p>
