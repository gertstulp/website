GENSI-- *Graphical Ego-centered Network Survey Interface* --is a novel graphical tool that was developed to collect ego-centered network data. It was developed by Tobias Stark and Jon Krosnick [see [Stark's website](http://www.tobiasstark.nl/GENSI/GENSI.htm) and the [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873316300284) in the journal *Social Networks* ] 

For my own research, I have extended the original software to be able to collect large personal networks (on 25 'alters').

You can see a preview of my survey (in Dutch) here:

And you can do my survey [here](http://stulp.gmw.rug.nl/phptmp/survey.php) (in Dutch).

You can download all the files to run this survey [here](/pdf/GENSI_Stulp_Social_Networks_and_Fertility.zip). [for the license of this software, [see](http://www.tobiasstark.nl/GENSI/GENSI.htm)]
