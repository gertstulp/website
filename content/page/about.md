I am a passionate explorer of all things data, statistics, and [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats). Lately, I've been focused on incorporating best practices from open science and reproducible research to the corporate world through workflow improvement and internal tool development. More broadly, I love exploratory data anaylsis and modeling. 

Previously, I studied at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I earned degrees in Mathematics and Mathematical Decision Sciences (Stats/OR) and completed my Honors Thesis on discrete event simulation in emergency medicene. My professional experience has focused on consumer credit domain, but I'm eager to continue learning and exploring areas such as healthcare and transportation as well.

When I'm not crunching numbers, I enjoy reading, weightlifting, and watching college basketball (Go Tar Heels!)
