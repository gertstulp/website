Hannah Dietzenbacher has done amazing work in her Master's Thesis project **Criminal Network Disruption: A simulation study on the effectiveness of law enforcement intervention strategies**. Both her theory-driven approach as well as her simulation-approach were impressive. 

She won three prizes for this research: 
1) The Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences (University of Groningen) thesis prize

2) The Jan Brouwer Scriptie Prijs voor Maatschappijwetenschappen (see [here](https://khmw.nl/negen-masterstudenten-vallen-in-de-prijzen-bekijk-hier-de-presentaties-van-de-winnaars/))

3) The NSV thesis prize (see [here](https://www.nsv-sociologie.nl/?page_id=3678))

What a star!
