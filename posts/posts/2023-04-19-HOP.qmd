[Data Wise: data science in society](https://www.rug.nl/gmw/education/minor/datawise?lang=en) was nominated for the Hogeronderwijspremie. This 'minor' program (for third-year bachelor students) teaches students to work in teams on a societally relevant topic that requires data. 

[Ronald Stolk](https://www.rug.nl/staff/r.p.stolk/cv?lang=en), [Anne Beaulieu](https://www.rug.nl/staff/j.a.beaulieu/?lang=en), and myself have worked hard to get the program off the ground, and since then many excellent people have contributed (and are contributing) to the program.

We got far, top 6, but didn't make it to the final three, unfortunately.
