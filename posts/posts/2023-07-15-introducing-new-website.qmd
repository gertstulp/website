## Something new, something old

I have a new website. The reason is that the old website partly stopped functioning, because I relied on the Hugo Academic theme. This theme got commercialised and some functionality stopped working. I decided to turn to a Quarto website, which is much better because I understand the underlying code better. 

My process is something like: I love making a new website, change a lot, update it frequently in the first weeks. Then I lose interest. Five years after I do a complete rehaul. That's where we are now. I have a problem. 

I browsed the interweb to see if there were nice, Quarto-based websites, and stumbled upon this: [Real World Data Science](https://realworlddatascience.net/). Another one that I liked was [ellakaye.co.uk](https://ellakaye.co.uk/), from which I copied the logo in the upper left corner.

Useful for the website, was the installation of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) through these Quarto-plugins ([FA](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome) and [Academicons](https://github.com/schochastics/academicons))

## page-layout: aaaaaahhhhhrticle

Something that I have struggled with most is the following: I though I was able to change the dimensions of the page. For example, in the `_quarto.yml` page, I can adapt the [following](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/page-layout.html):

```
format:
  html: 
    grid:
      sidebar-width: 300px
      body-width: 900px
      margin-width: 300px
```

It took me a long time to realise (of which I am still not sure) that this only partly holds for `page-layout: custom` and **not** for `page-layout: article` or `page-layout: full`. For example, a `sidebar-width: 0px` (remove the sidebar on the left completely) would only work for the landing/home page (which is `custom`), but not for other pages. I believe that this has to do with the issue that the default set-up in quarto is responsive to device (e.g., phone, table, computer), such that content is scaled appropriately to smaller / larger screen. 

I 'resolved' this issue, by accepting the default width of the `content` of the (article) page (around `900px`), and adapted my landing page accordingly. 

Why did I wanted this? On my website, I have three columns that include content plus visualisations in little rectangles These rectangles automatically adjust size given other content on the screen, window size, device, et cetera. This led to 'problems'. On most pages, there is a table of contents in the `margin`-area, which 'pushes' the three columns to the left on the screen. Now on my landing page, I do not have this margin area at all. The issue was that because of this, the rectangles had a different size on the landing page versus all other pages, and some images were cropped weirdly because of it. I wanted, no I needed, consistency across pages and avoid weird cropping. Eight hours well spent!  



## Converting talks

The biggest 'problem' was that I had lists of publications, blogs, and talks that included Hugo-code. For many of these files, I had to change the YAML at the start of each file. The below describes how I automatised this process. 

The original files look something like this:

```{r} 
#| eval: false
+++
date = "2021-11-15T00:00:00"
title = "A roadmap on how to be as open as possible, and as closed as necessary"
authors = ["Gert Stulp"]
abstract = "During this event, we aimed at creating a roadmap that help researchers navigate GDPR and Open Science"
abstract_short = ""
event = "Official Launch Groningen Digital Competence Center"
event_url = "https://www.rug.nl/digital-competence-centre/calendar/2021/gdcc-official-launch"
location = "Groningen, the Netherlands"

selected = true
math = true

url_pdf = "/pdf/2021_YAG_OSCG_DCC.pdf"
url_slides = ""
url_video = ""


# Optional featured image (relative to `static/img/` folder).
[header]
image = ""
caption = ""

+++
```

And need to be transformed to something like this:

```{r} 
#| eval: false
---
title: "A roadmap on how to be as open as possible, and as closed as necessary"

### Read-in template

I made a template that each talk should conform to and stored it into an .md file. This is the content of said file. The string `replace_title`, `replace_date`, `replace_event_title`, `location_event`, `url_for_event`, `url_for_pdf`, and `description_text` need to be replaced by text that come from the original markdown-files that include Hugo code.

```{r} 
#| eval: false

title: replace_title

  description_text 
categories:

```{r} 
#| eval: false
# List files in directory "talk/" with .md extension
file_list <- list.files("talk/", pattern = paste0(".*", ".md"), full.names = TRUE)
```



### Replace text and store new files in new folder 

```{r} 
#| eval: false
library(stringr)

replace_text_md <- function(file_path) {
  # Read-in document
  lines <- readLines(file_path)

  # Function to remove annoying slashes from relevant text

  temp <- template
  # remove line in template when link to pdf, website from event, or video does not exist
  if(url == "") {
   temp <- temp[!str_detect(temp, "fa window-maximize")] 
  } else {

  } else {
    temp <- str_replace_all(temp, "url_for_video", url_video)
  }
  # if image is provided, use that one rather than the template-figure
  if(url_image != "") {
    temp <- str_replace_all(temp, c("new_event.png" = url_image))
  }
  
  temp <- str_replace_all(
    temp,
    c("replace_title" = title,
      "description_text" = abstract,
      "insert_date" = date,
      "replace_event_title" = event,
      "location_event" = location
    )
  )

  # Folder talks_converted should exist
  path_output <- paste0("talks_converted/", str_remove(file_path, "talk//"))
  writeLines(temp, path_output, sep = "\n")
}

# For each file in the original folder
for(file in file_list) {
  replace_text_md(file)  
}
```


## Converting publications

For publications something similar holds. The original files look something like this:

```{r} 
#| eval: false

abstract = "The Dutch have a remarkable history when it comes to height. From being one of the shortest European populations in the 19th Century, the Dutch grew some 20 cm and are currently the tallest population in the world. Wealth, hygiene, and diet are well-established contributors to this major increase in height. Some have suggested that natural selection may also contribute to the trend, but evidence is weak. Here, we investigate the potential role of natural selection in the increase in height through simulations. We first ask what if natural selection was solely responsible for the observed increase in height? If the increase in average height was fully due to natural selection on male height, then across six consecutive generations, men who were two standard deviation above average height would need to have eight times more children on average. If selection acted only through those who have the opportunity to reproduce, then reproduction would need to be restricted to the tallest third (37%) of the population in order to give rise to the stark increase in height over time. No linear relationship between height and child mortality is able to account for the increase over time. We then present simulations based on previously observed estimates of partnership, mortality, selection and heritability and show that natural selection had a negligible effect (estimates from 0.07 to 0.36 cm) on the increase in height in the period 1850 to 2000. Our simulations highlight the plasticity of height and how remarkable the trend in height is in evolutionary terms. Only by using a combination of methods and insights from different disciplines, including biology, demography, and history are we potentially able to address how much of the increase in height is due to natural selection versus other causes."

## Abstract

The Dutch have a remarkable history when it comes to height. From being one of the shortest European populations in the 19th Century, the Dutch grew some 20 cm and are currently the tallest population in the world. Wealth, hygiene, and diet are well-established contributors to this major increase in height. Some have suggested that natural selection may also contribute to the trend, but evidence is weak. Here, we investigate the potential role of natural selection in the increase in height through simulations. We first ask what if natural selection was solely responsible for the observed increase in height? If the increase in average height was fully due to natural selection on male height, then across six consecutive generations, men who were two standard deviation above average height would need to have eight times more children on average. If selection acted only through those who have the opportunity to reproduce, then reproduction would need to be restricted to the tallest third (37%) of the population in order to give rise to the stark increase in height over time. No linear relationship between height and child mortality is able to account for the increase over time. We then present simulations based on previously observed estimates of partnership, mortality, selection and heritability and show that natural selection had a negligible effect (estimates from 0.07 to 0.36 cm) on the increase in height in the period 1850 to 2000. Our simulations highlight the plasticity of height and how remarkable the trend in height is in evolutionary terms. Only by using a combination of methods and insights from different disciplines, including biology, demography, and history are we potentially able to address how much of the increase in height is due to natural selection versus other causes.
