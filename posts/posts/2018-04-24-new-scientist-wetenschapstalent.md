I am fortunate enough to have been nominated for the [New Scientist Wetenschapstalent 2018](https://www.rug.nl/news/2018/04/socioloog-gert-stulp-genomineerd-voor-new-scientist-wetenschapstalent-2018). The 'winner' will be determined by a committee and by popular vote (how scientific!). You can vote [here](newscientist.nl/talent) if you think my research is good, or if you think I am not half-bad as a researcher.

For a quick Dutch video of my research, see:
