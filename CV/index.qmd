Here you can find my [CV](../pdf/CV_Gert_Stulp_March_2024.pdf), including my educational and occupational history and a list of publications.

For a list of additional activities, some of which have occurred quite some time ago, and that seem less relevant or even embarrassing to include in my full CV, [see here](../pdf/CV_Gert_Stulp_March 2024_addendum.pdf).
