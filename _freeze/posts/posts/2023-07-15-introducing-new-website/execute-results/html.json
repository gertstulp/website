The reason is that the old website partly stopped functioning, because I relied on the Hugo Academic theme. This theme got commercialised and some functionality stopped working. I decided to turn to a Quarto website, which is much better because I understand the underlying code better. \n\nMy process is something like: I love making a new website, change a lot, update it frequently in the first weeks. Then I lose interest. Five years after I do a complete rehaul. That's where we are now. I have a problem. \n\nI browsed the interweb to see if there were nice, Quarto-based websites, and stumbled upon this: [Real World Data Science](https://realworlddatascience.net/). Another one that I liked was [ellakaye.co.uk](https://ellakaye.co.uk/), from which I copied the logo in the upper left corner.\n\nUseful for the website, was the installation of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) through these Quarto-plugins ([FA](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome) and [Academicons](https://github.com/schochastics/academicons))\n\n## page-layout: aaaaaahhhhhrticle\n\nSomething that I have struggled with most is the following: I though I was able to change the dimensions of the page. For example, in the `_quarto.yml` page, I can adapt the [following](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/page-layout.html):\n\n```\nformat:\n  html: \n    grid:\n      sidebar-width: 300px\n      body-width: 900px\n      margin-width: 300px\n```\n\nIt took me a long time to realise (of which I am still not sure) that this only partly holds for `page-layout: custom` and **not** for `page-layout: article` or `page-layout: full`. For example, a `sidebar-width: 0px` (remove the sidebar on the left completely) would only work for the landing/home page (which is `custom`), but not for other pages. I believe that this has to do with the issue that the default set-up in quarto is responsive to device (e.g., phone, table, computer), such that content is scaled appropriately to smaller / larger screen. \n\nI 'resolved' this issue, by accepting the default width of the `content` of the (article) page (around `900px`), and adapted my landing page accordingly. \n\nWhy did I wanted this? On my website, I have three columns that include content plus visualisations in little rectangles These rectangles automatically adjust size given other content on the screen, window size, device, et cetera. This led to 'problems'. On most pages, there is a table of contents in the `margin`-area, which 'pushes' the three columns to the left on the screen. Now on my landing page, I do not have this margin area at all. The issue was that because of this, the rectangles had a different size on the landing page versus all other pages, and some images were cropped weirdly because of it. I wanted, no I needed, consistency across pages and avoid weird cropping. Eight hours well spent!  \n\n\n\n## Converting talks\n\nThe biggest 'problem' was that I had lists of publications, blogs, and talks that included Hugo-code. For many of these files, I had to change the YAML at the start of each file. The below describes how I automatised this process. \n\nThe original files look something like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n+++\ndate = \"2021-11-15T00:00:00\"\ntitle = \"A roadmap on how to be as open as possible, and as closed as necessary\"\nauthors = [\"Gert Stulp\"]\nabstract = \"During this event, we aimed at creating a roadmap that help researchers navigate GDPR and Open Science\"\nabstract_short = \"\"\nevent = \"Official Launch Groningen Digital Competence Center\"\nevent_url = \"https://www.rug.nl/digital-competence-centre/calendar/2021/gdcc-official-launch\"\nlocation = \"Groningen, the Netherlands\"\n\nselected = true\nmath = true\n\nurl_pdf = \"/pdf/2021_YAG_OSCG_DCC.pdf\"\nurl_slides = \"\"\nurl_video = \"\"\n\n\n# Optional featured image (relative to `static/img/` folder).\n[header]\nimage = \"\"\ncaption = \"\"\n\n+++\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd need to be transformed to something like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n---\ntitle: \"A roadmap on how to be as open as possible, and as closed as necessary\"\ndescription: |\n  During this event, we aimed at creating a roadmap that help researchers navigate GDPR and Open Science\ncategories:\n  - Talk\nauthor: \"Gert Stulp\"\ndate: \"2021-11-15T00:00:00\"\ntoc: true\nimage: ../../images/new_event.png\nimage-alt: New talk\nlanguage: \n    section-title-footnotes: References\n---\n\n\n## Summary \n<br>\n{{< fa podcast >}} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Official Launch Groningen Digital Competence Center\n\n{{< fa map-marker >}} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Groningen, the Netherlands\n\n{{< fa window-maximize >}} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click [here](https://www.rug.nl/digital-competence-centre/calendar/2021/gdcc-official-launch) for website\n\n{{< fa download >}} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download materials [here](\"/pdf/2021_YAG_OSCG_DCC.pdf\")\n\n\n## Description\n\nDuring this event, we aimed at creating a roadmap that help researchers navigate GDPR and Open Science\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Read-in template\n\nI made a template that each talk should conform to and stored it into an .md file.
