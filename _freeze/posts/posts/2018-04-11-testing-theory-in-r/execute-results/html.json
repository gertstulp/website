Didn't doubt it at all, just thought it would be fun checking this theory (theorem?) in **R**:\n\nLet's build a function that can test this. We'll do it one million times, and then calculate the mean (that should be equal to **e**).\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntest_theory <- function(no_tests = 10) {\n  results <- vector(mode = \"integer\", length = no_tests)\n  \n  for(i in 1:no_tests) {\n    sum = 0\n    cnt = 0\n    while(sum <= 1) {\n      sum = sum + runif(1, min = 0, max = 1)\n      cnt = cnt + 1\n    }\n    results[i] = cnt\n  }\n  return(mean(results))\n}\ntest_theory(1000000)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2.719122\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**e** in **R** is 2.7182818\n\n\nFor a mathematical breakdown [that is beyond my comprehension], see [this website](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/111314/choose-a-random-number-between-0-and-1-and-record-its-value-keep-doing-it-until).",
