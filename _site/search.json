    "text": "Davit’s journey towards reproducibility\n\nMore power, please\nThe focus of my bachelor’s thesis was to better understand the initial spread of Covid-19 in China using deep learning algorithms. I was keen to make my work reproducible, but not only for my own sake. The “reproducibility crisis” is a well-documented problem in science as a whole,1 2 3 4 with studies suggesting that around one-third of social science studies published between the years 2010 and 2015 in top journals like Nature and Science could not be reproduced.5 Results that cannot be reproduced are not necessarily “wrong”. But, if findings cannot be reproduced, we cannot be sure of their validity.\nFor my own research project, I gathered all data and started working on my computer. After I built the algorithms to train the data, my first challenge to reproducibility was computational. I realised that training models on my local computer was taking far too long, and I needed a faster, more powerful solution to be able to submit my thesis in time. Fortunately, I could access the university server to train the algorithms. Once the training was complete, I could generate the results on my local computer, since producing maps and tables was not so demanding. However…\n\n\nBloody paths!\nIn switching between machines and computing environments, I soon encountered an issue with my code: the paths, or file directory locations, for the trained algorithms had been hardcoded! As I quickly discovered, hardcoding a path can lead to issues when the code is run in a different environment, as the path might not exist in the new environment.\nAs my code became longer, I overlooked the path names linked to algorithms that were generating the results. This mistake – which would have been easily corrected if spotted earlier – resulted in incorrect outputs. Such errors could have enormous (negative) implications in a public health context, where evidence-based decisions have real impacts on human lives. It was at this point that I realised that my code is the fundamental pillar of the validity of my empirical work. How can someone trust my work if they are not able to verify it?\nThe following dummy code demonstrates the hardcoding issue:\n```{python}\n# Hardcoded path\nfile_path = \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\"\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nIn the code above, a dummy file (toydata.csv) is used. The dummy file contains data on the prices of three different toys, but only the path of the file is relevant to this example. If the hardcoded file path – \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\" – exists on the machine being used, the code will run just fine. But, when run in a different environment without said path, the code will result in a \"File not found error\". Better code that uses relative paths can be written as:\n```{python}\n# Relative path\nimport os\n\nfile_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"toydata.csv\")\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nYou can see that this code has successfully imported data from the dataset toydata.csv and printed its two columns (toy and price) and three rows.\nThe following example is a simplified version of what happened when I wrote code to train several models, store the results and run a procedure to compare results with the predictive performance of a benchmark model:\n```{python}\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\"}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\"}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model1.csv', index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Load the model result and compare with benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model\nresult = pd.read_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model2.csv').iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nEverything looks fine at a glance. But, if you examine the code carefully, you may spot the problem. Initially, when I coded the procedure (training the model, saving and loading the results), I hardcoded the paths and had to change them for each tested model. First, I trained model2, a complex model, and tested it against the benchmark (70 > 50 → accepted). I repeated the procedure for model1 (a simple model). Its result was identical to model2, therefore I kept model1 following the parsimony principle.\nHowever, for the code line loading the result for the current model (line 5, second cell), I forgot to amend the path and so mistakenly loaded the result of model2. As a consequence, I accepted a model which should have been rejected. These wrong results were then spread further in the code, including all charts and maps and the conclusions of my analysis.\nA small coding error like this can therefore be fatal to an analysis. Below is the corrected code:\n```{python}\nimport os\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details (INCLUDING PATHS) in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model1.csv\")}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model2.csv\")}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv(current_model[\"path\"], index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Get the model result and compare with the benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model WITH a VARIABLE PATH\nresult = pd.read_csv(current_model[\"path\"]).iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nHere, the paths are stored with other model details (line 7–8, first cell). Therefore, we can use them as variables when we need them (e.g., line 16, first cell, and line 5, second cell). Now, when the current model is set to model1 (line 11, first cell), everything is automatically adjusted. Also, if the path details need to be changed, we only need to change them once and everything else is automatically adjusted and updated. The code now correctly states that model1 performs worse than the benchmark and is therefore rejected and we should keep model2, which performs best.\nI managed to catch this error in time, but it often can be difficult to spot our own mistakes. That is why making code available to others is crucial. A code review by a second (or third) pair of eyes can save everyone a lot of time and avoid spreading incorrect results and conclusions.\n\n\nSolving compatibility chaos with Docker\nOne might think that it would be easy to copy code from one computer to another and run it without difficulties, but it turns out to be a real headache. Different operating systems on my local computer and the university server caused multiple compatibility issues and it was very time-consuming to try to solve them. The university server was running on Ubuntu, a Linux distribution, which was not compatible with my macOS-based code editor. Moreover, the server did not support the Python programming language – and all the deep learning algorithm packages that I needed – in the same way as my macOS computer did.\nAs a remedy, I used Docker containers, which allowed me to create a virtual environment with all the necessary packages and dependencies installed. This way, I could integrate them with different hardware and use the processing power of that hardware. To get started with Docker, I first had to install it on my local computer. The installation process is straightforward and the Docker website provides step-by-step instructions for different operating systems. In fact, I found the Docker website very helpful, with lots of resources and tutorials available. Once Docker was installed, it was easy to create virtual environments for my project and work with my code, libraries, and packages, without any compatibility issues. Not only did Docker containers save me a lot of time and effort, but they could also make it easier for others to reproduce my work.\nBelow is an example of a Dockerfile which recreates an environment with Python 3.7 on Linux. It describes what, how, when and in which order operations should be carried out to generate the environment with all Python packages required to run the main Python script, main.py.\n\n\nAn example of a Dockerfile.\n\nIn this example, by downloading the project, including the Dockerfile, anyone can run main.py without installing packages or worrying about what OS was used for development or which Python version should be installed. You can view Docker as a great robot chef: show it a recipe (Dockerfile), provide the ingredients (project files), push the start button (to build the container) and wait to sample the results.\n\n\nWhy does nobody check your code?\nEven after implementing Docker, I still faced another challenge to reproducibility: making the verification process for my code easy enough that it could be done by anyone, without them needing a degree in computer science! Increasingly, there is an expectation for researchers to share their code so that results can be reproduced, but there are as yet no widely accepted or enforced standards on how to make code readable and reusable. However, if we are to embrace the concept of reproducibility, we must write and publish code under the assumption that someone, somewhere – boss, team member, journal reviewer, reader – will want to rerun our code. And, if we expect that someone will want to rerun our code (and hopefully check it), we should ensure that the code is readable and does not take too long to run.\nIf your code does take too long to run, some operations can often be accelerated – for example, by reducing the size of the datasets or by implementing computationally efficient data processing approaches (e.g., using PyTorch). Aim for a running time of a few minutes – or about as long as it takes to make a cup of tea or coffee. Of course, if data needs to be reduced to save computational time, the person rerunning your code won’t generate the same results as in your original analysis. This therefore will not lead to reproducibility, sensu stricto. However, as long as you state clearly what are the expected results from the reduced dataset, your peers can at least inspect your code and offer feedback, and this marks a step towards reproducibility.\nWe should also make sure our code is free from bugs – both the kind that might lead to errors in analysis and also those that stop the code running to completion. Bugs can occur for various reasons. For example, some code chunks written on a Windows machine may not properly execute on a macOS machine because the former uses \\ for file paths, while the latter uses /:\n```{python}\n# Path works on macOS/Linux\nwith open(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n\n# Path works only on Windows    \nwith open(r\"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n   print(f.read())\n```\n\nHere, only the macOS/Linux version works, since the code this capture was taken from was implemented on a Linux server. There are alternatives, however. The code below works on macOS, Linux, and also Windows machines:\n```{python}\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Path works on every OS: macOS/Linux/Windows\n# It will automatically replace the path to \"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\" when it runs on Windows\nwith open(Path(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\"), \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n```\n\nThe extra Python package, pathlib, is of course unnecessary if you build a Docker container for your project, as discussed in the previous section.\n\n\nJupyter, King of the Notebooks\nBy this stage in my project, I was feeling that I’d made good progress towards ensuring that my work would be reproducible. I’d expended a lot of effort to make my code readable, efficient, and also absent of bugs (or, at least, this is what I was hoping for). I’d also built a Docker container to allow others to replicate my computing environment and rerun the analysis. Still, I wanted to make sure there were no barriers that would prevent people – my supervisors, in particular – from being able to review the work I had done for my undergraduate thesis. What I wanted was a way to present a complete narrative of my project that was easy to understand and follow. For this, I turned to Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nJupyter notebooks combine Markdown text, code, and visualisations. The notebook itself can sit within an online directory of folders and files that contain all the data and code related to a project, allowing readers to understand the processes behind the work and also access the raw resources. From the notebook I produced, readers can see exactly what I did, how I did it, and what my results were.\nWhile creating my notebook, I was able to experiment with my code and iterate quickly. Code cells within a document can be run interactively, which allowed me to try out different approaches to solving a problem and see the results almost in real time. I could also get feedback from others and try out new ideas without having to spend a lot of time writing and debugging code.\n\n\nVersion control with Git and GitHub\nMy Jupyter notebook and associated folders and files are all available via GitHub. Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a central repository for storing and sharing code. With Git and GitHub, I was able to version my code and collaborate with others without the risk of losing any work. I really couldn’t afford to redo the entire year I spent on my dissertation!\nGit and GitHub are great for reproducibility. By sharing code via these platforms, others can access your work, verify it and reproduce your results without risking changing or, worse, destroying your work – whether partially or completely. These tools also make it easy for others to build on your work if they want to further develop your research. You can also use Git and GitHub to share or promote your results across a wider community. The ability to easily store and share your code also makes it easy to keep track of the different versions of your code and to see how your work has evolved.\nThe following illustration shows the tracking of very simple changes in a Python file. The previous version of the code is shown on the left; the new version is shown on the right. Additions and deletions are highlighted in green and red, and with + and - symbols, respectively.\n\n\nA simple example of GitHub version tracking."

    "text": "The deep learning challenge\nSo far, this article has dealt with barriers to reproducibility – and ways around them – that will apply to most, if not all, modern research projects. While I’d encourage any scientist to adopt these practices in their own work, it is important to stress that these alone cannot guarantee reproducibility. In cases where standard statistical procedures are used within statistical software packages, reproducibility is often achievable. However, in reality, even when following the same procedures, differences in outputs can occur, and identifying the reasons for this may be challenging. Cooking offers a simple analogy: subtle changes in room temperature or ingredient quality from one day to the next can impact the final product.\nOne of the challenges for research projects employing machine learning and deep learning algorithms is that outputs can be influenced by the randomness that is inherent in these approaches. Consider the four portraits below, generated by the Midjourney bot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nEach portrait looks broadly similar at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, critical differences emerge. These differences arise because deep learning models rely on numerous interconnected layers to learn intricate patterns and representations. Slight random perturbations, such as initial parameter values or changes in data samples, can propagate through the network, leading to different decisions during the learning process. As a result, even seemingly negligible randomness can amplify and manifest as considerable differences in the final output, as with the distinct features of the portraits.\nRandomness is not necessarily a bad thing – it mitigates overfitting and helps predictions to be generalised. However, it does present an additional barrier to reproducibility. If you cannot get the same results using the same raw materials – data, code, packages and computing environment – then you might have good reasons to doubt the validity of the findings.\nThere are many elements of an analysis in which randomness may be present and lead to different results. For example, in a classification (where your dependent variable is binary, e.g., success/failure with 1 and 0) or a regression (where your dependent variable is continuous, e.g., temperature measurements of 10.1°C, 2.8°C, etc.), you might need to split your data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to estimate the model (hyper)parameters and the testing set is used to compute the performance of the model. The way the split is usually operationalised is as a random selection of rows of your data. So, in principle, each time you split your data into training and testing sets, you may end up with different rows in each set. Differences in the training set may therefore lead to different values of the model (hyper)parameters and affect the predictive performance that is measured from the testing set. Also, differences in the testing set may lead to variations in the predictive performance scores, which in turn lead to potentially different interpretations and, ultimately, decisions if the results are used for that purpose.\nThis aspect of randomness in the training of models is relatively well known. But randomness may hide in other parts of code. One such example is illustrated below. Here, using Python, we set the seed number to 0 using np.random.seed(seed value). The random.seed() function from the package numpy (abbreviated np) saves the state of a random function so that it can create identical random numbers independently of the machine you use, and this is for any number of executions. A seed value is an initial input or starting point used by a pseudorandom number generator to generate a sequence of random numbers. It is often an integer or a timestamp. The number generator takes this seed value and uses it to produce a deterministic series of random numbers that appear to be random but can be recreated by using the same seed value. Without providing this seed value, the first execution of the function typically uses the current system time. The animation below generates two random arrays arr1 and arr2 using np.random.rand(3,2). Note that the values 3,2 indicate that we want random values for an array that has 3 rows and 2 columns.\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\n\n#Set the seed number e.g. to 0\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Set the seed number as before to get the same results\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nIf you run the code yourself multiple times, the values of arr1 and arr2 should remain identical. If this is not the case, check that the seed value is set to 0 in lines 4 and 11. These identical results are possible because we set the seed value to 0, which ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers each time the code is run. Now, let’s look at what happens if we remove the line np.random.seed(0):\n```{python}\n#Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nHere, the values of arr1 and arr2 will be different each time we run the code since the seed value was not set and is therefore changing over time.\nThis short code demonstrates how randomness that can be controlled by the seed value may affect your code. Therefore, unless randomness is required, e.g., to get some uncertainty in the results, setting the seed value will contribute to making your work reproducible. I also find it helpful to document the seed number I use in my code so that I can easily reproduce my findings in the future. If you are currently working on some code that involves random number generators, it might be worth checking your code and making all necessary changes. In our work (see code chunk 9 in the Jupyter notebook) we set the seed value in a general way, using a framework (config) so that our code always uses the same seed to train our algorithm."

We have explained why reproducibility matters and provided tips for how to achieve it – or, at least, work towards it. We have introduced a few important issues that you are likely to encounter on your own path to reproducibility. In sum, we have mentioned:\n\nThe importance of having relative instead of hard-coded paths in code.\nOperating system compatibility issues, which can be solved by using Docker containers for a consistent computing environment.\nThe convenience of Jupyter notebooks for code editing – particularly useful for data science projects and work using deep learning because of the ability to include text and code in the same document and make the work accessible to everyone (so long as they have an internet connection).\nThe need for version control using, for example, Git and GitHub, which allows you to keep track of changes in your code and collaborate with others efficiently.\nThe importance of setting the seed values in random number generators.\n\nThe graphic below provides a visual overview of the different components of our study and shows how each component works with the others to support reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use (A) the version control system, Git, and its hosting service, GitHub, which enables a team to share code with peers, efficiently track and synchronise code changes between local and server machines, and reset the project to a working state in case something breaks. Docker containers (B) include all necessary objects (engine, data, and scripts). Docker needs to be installed (plain-line arrows) by all users (project leader, collaborator(s), reviewer(s), and public user(s)) on their local machines (C); and (D) we use a user-friendly interface (JupyterLab) deployed from a local machine to facilitate the operations required to reproduce the work. The project leader and collaborators can edit (upload/download) the project files stored on the GitHub server (plain-line arrows) while reviewers and public users can only read the files (dotted-line arrows).\nNow, it is over to you. Our Jupyter notebook provides a walkthrough of our research. Our GitHub repository has all the data, code and other files you need to reproduce our work, and this README file will help you get started.\nAnd with that, we wish you all the best on the road to reproducibility!\n\nFind more case studies\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the authors\n\nDavit Svanidze is a master’s degree student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE).

    "text": "Davit’s journey towards reproducibility\n\nMore power, please\nThe focus of my bachelor’s thesis was to better understand the initial spread of Covid-19 in China using deep learning algorithms. I was keen to make my work reproducible, but not only for my own sake. The “reproducibility crisis” is a well-documented problem in science as a whole,1 2 3 4 with studies suggesting that around one-third of social science studies published between the years 2010 and 2015 in top journals like Nature and Science could not be reproduced.5 Results that cannot be reproduced are not necessarily “wrong”. But, if findings cannot be reproduced, we cannot be sure of their validity.\nFor my own research project, I gathered all data and started working on my computer. After I built the algorithms to train the data, my first challenge to reproducibility was computational. I realised that training models on my local computer was taking far too long, and I needed a faster, more powerful solution to be able to submit my thesis in time. Fortunately, I could access the university server to train the algorithms. Once the training was complete, I could generate the results on my local computer, since producing maps and tables was not so demanding. However…\n\n\nBloody paths!\nIn switching between machines and computing environments, I soon encountered an issue with my code: the paths, or file directory locations, for the trained algorithms had been hardcoded! As I quickly discovered, hardcoding a path can lead to issues when the code is run in a different environment, as the path might not exist in the new environment.\nAs my code became longer, I overlooked the path names linked to algorithms that were generating the results. This mistake – which would have been easily corrected if spotted earlier – resulted in incorrect outputs. Such errors could have enormous (negative) implications in a public health context, where evidence-based decisions have real impacts on human lives. It was at this point that I realised that my code is the fundamental pillar of the validity of my empirical work. How can someone trust my work if they are not able to verify it?\nThe following dummy code demonstrates the hardcoding issue:\n```{python}\n# Hardcoded path\nfile_path = \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\"\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nIn the code above, a dummy file (toydata.csv) is used. The dummy file contains data on the prices of three different toys, but only the path of the file is relevant to this example. If the hardcoded file path – \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\" – exists on the machine being used, the code will run just fine. But, when run in a different environment without said path, the code will result in a \"File not found error\". Better code that uses relative paths can be written as:\n```{python}\n# Relative path\nimport os\n\nfile_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"toydata.csv\")\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nYou can see that this code has successfully imported data from the dataset toydata.csv and printed its two columns (toy and price) and three rows.\nThe following example is a simplified version of what happened when I wrote code to train several models, store the results and run a procedure to compare results with the predictive performance of a benchmark model:\n```{python}\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\"}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\"}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model1.csv', index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Load the model result and compare with benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model\nresult = pd.read_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model2.csv').iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nEverything looks fine at a glance. But, if you examine the code carefully, you may spot the problem. Initially, when I coded the procedure (training the model, saving and loading the results), I hardcoded the paths and had to change them for each tested model. First, I trained model2, a complex model, and tested it against the benchmark (70 > 50 → accepted). I repeated the procedure for model1 (a simple model). Its result was identical to model2, therefore I kept model1 following the parsimony principle.\nHowever, for the code line loading the result for the current model (line 5, second cell), I forgot to amend the path and so mistakenly loaded the result of model2. As a consequence, I accepted a model which should have been rejected. These wrong results were then spread further in the code, including all charts and maps and the conclusions of my analysis.\nA small coding error like this can therefore be fatal to an analysis. Below is the corrected code:\n```{python}\nimport os\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details (INCLUDING PATHS) in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model1.csv\")}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model2.csv\")}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv(current_model[\"path\"], index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Get the model result and compare with the benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model WITH a VARIABLE PATH\nresult = pd.read_csv(current_model[\"path\"]).iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nHere, the paths are stored with other model details (line 7–8, first cell). Therefore, we can use them as variables when we need them (e.g., line 16, first cell, and line 5, second cell). Now, when the current model is set to model1 (line 11, first cell), everything is automatically adjusted. Also, if the path details need to be changed, we only need to change them once and everything else is automatically adjusted and updated. The code now correctly states that model1 performs worse than the benchmark and is therefore rejected and we should keep model2, which performs best.\nI managed to catch this error in time, but it often can be difficult to spot our own mistakes. That is why making code available to others is crucial. A code review by a second (or third) pair of eyes can save everyone a lot of time and avoid spreading incorrect results and conclusions.\n\n\nSolving compatibility chaos with Docker\nOne might think that it would be easy to copy code from one computer to another and run it without difficulties, but it turns out to be a real headache. Different operating systems on my local computer and the university server caused multiple compatibility issues and it was very time-consuming to try to solve them. The university server was running on Ubuntu, a Linux distribution, which was not compatible with my macOS-based code editor. Moreover, the server did not support the Python programming language – and all the deep learning algorithm packages that I needed – in the same way as my macOS computer did.\nAs a remedy, I used Docker containers, which allowed me to create a virtual environment with all the necessary packages and dependencies installed. This way, I could integrate them with different hardware and use the processing power of that hardware. To get started with Docker, I first had to install it on my local computer. The installation process is straightforward and the Docker website provides step-by-step instructions for different operating systems. In fact, I found the Docker website very helpful, with lots of resources and tutorials available. Once Docker was installed, it was easy to create virtual environments for my project and work with my code, libraries, and packages, without any compatibility issues. Not only did Docker containers save me a lot of time and effort, but they could also make it easier for others to reproduce my work.\nBelow is an example of a Dockerfile which recreates an environment with Python 3.7 on Linux. It describes what, how, when and in which order operations should be carried out to generate the environment with all Python packages required to run the main Python script, main.py.\n\n\nAn example of a Dockerfile.\n\nIn this example, by downloading the project, including the Dockerfile, anyone can run main.py without installing packages or worrying about what OS was used for development or which Python version should be installed. You can view Docker as a great robot chef: show it a recipe (Dockerfile), provide the ingredients (project files), push the start button (to build the container) and wait to sample the results.\n\n\nWhy does nobody check your code?\nEven after implementing Docker, I still faced another challenge to reproducibility: making the verification process for my code easy enough that it could be done by anyone, without them needing a degree in computer science! Increasingly, there is an expectation for researchers to share their code so that results can be reproduced, but there are as yet no widely accepted or enforced standards on how to make code readable and reusable. However, if we are to embrace the concept of reproducibility, we must write and publish code under the assumption that someone, somewhere – boss, team member, journal reviewer, reader – will want to rerun our code. And, if we expect that someone will want to rerun our code (and hopefully check it), we should ensure that the code is readable and does not take too long to run.\nIf your code does take too long to run, some operations can often be accelerated – for example, by reducing the size of the datasets or by implementing computationally efficient data processing approaches (e.g., using PyTorch). Aim for a running time of a few minutes – or about as long as it takes to make a cup of tea or coffee. Of course, if data needs to be reduced to save computational time, the person rerunning your code won’t generate the same results as in your original analysis. This therefore will not lead to reproducibility, sensu stricto. However, as long as you state clearly what are the expected results from the reduced dataset, your peers can at least inspect your code and offer feedback, and this marks a step towards reproducibility.\nWe should also make sure our code is free from bugs – both the kind that might lead to errors in analysis and also those that stop the code running to completion. Bugs can occur for various reasons. For example, some code chunks written on a Windows machine may not properly execute on a macOS machine because the former uses \\ for file paths, while the latter uses /:\n```{python}\n# Path works on macOS/Linux\nwith open(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n\n# Path works only on Windows    \nwith open(r\"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n   print(f.read())\n```\n\nHere, only the macOS/Linux version works, since the code this capture was taken from was implemented on a Linux server. There are alternatives, however. The code below works on macOS, Linux, and also Windows machines:\n```{python}\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Path works on every OS: macOS/Linux/Windows\n# It will automatically replace the path to \"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\" when it runs on Windows\nwith open(Path(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\"), \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n```\n\nThe extra Python package, pathlib, is of course unnecessary if you build a Docker container for your project, as discussed in the previous section.\n\n\nJupyter, King of the Notebooks\nBy this stage in my project, I was feeling that I’d made good progress towards ensuring that my work would be reproducible. I’d expended a lot of effort to make my code readable, efficient, and also absent of bugs (or, at least, this is what I was hoping for). I’d also built a Docker container to allow others to replicate my computing environment and rerun the analysis. Still, I wanted to make sure there were no barriers that would prevent people – my supervisors, in particular – from being able to review the work I had done for my undergraduate thesis. What I wanted was a way to present a complete narrative of my project that was easy to understand and follow. For this, I turned to Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nJupyter notebooks combine Markdown text, code, and visualisations. The notebook itself can sit within an online directory of folders and files that contain all the data and code related to a project, allowing readers to understand the processes behind the work and also access the raw resources. From the notebook I produced, readers can see exactly what I did, how I did it, and what my results were.\nWhile creating my notebook, I was able to experiment with my code and iterate quickly. Code cells within a document can be run interactively, which allowed me to try out different approaches to solving a problem and see the results almost in real time. I could also get feedback from others and try out new ideas without having to spend a lot of time writing and debugging code.\n\n\nVersion control with Git and GitHub\nMy Jupyter notebook and associated folders and files are all available via GitHub. Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a central repository for storing and sharing code. With Git and GitHub, I was able to version my code and collaborate with others without the risk of losing any work. I really couldn’t afford to redo the entire year I spent on my dissertation!\nGit and GitHub are great for reproducibility. By sharing code via these platforms, others can access your work, verify it and reproduce your results without risking changing or, worse, destroying your work – whether partially or completely. These tools also make it easy for others to build on your work if they want to further develop your research. You can also use Git and GitHub to share or promote your results across a wider community. The ability to easily store and share your code also makes it easy to keep track of the different versions of your code and to see how your work has evolved.\nThe following illustration shows the tracking of very simple changes in a Python file. The previous version of the code is shown on the left; the new version is shown on the right. Additions and deletions are highlighted in green and red, and with + and - symbols, respectively.\n\n\nA simple example of GitHub version tracking."

    "text": "The deep learning challenge\nSo far, this article has dealt with barriers to reproducibility – and ways around them – that will apply to most, if not all, modern research projects. While I’d encourage any scientist to adopt these practices in their own work, it is important to stress that these alone cannot guarantee reproducibility. In cases where standard statistical procedures are used within statistical software packages, reproducibility is often achievable. However, in reality, even when following the same procedures, differences in outputs can occur, and identifying the reasons for this may be challenging. Cooking offers a simple analogy: subtle changes in room temperature or ingredient quality from one day to the next can impact the final product.\nOne of the challenges for research projects employing machine learning and deep learning algorithms is that outputs can be influenced by the randomness that is inherent in these approaches. Consider the four portraits below, generated by the Midjourney bot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nEach portrait looks broadly similar at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, critical differences emerge. These differences arise because deep learning models rely on numerous interconnected layers to learn intricate patterns and representations. Slight random perturbations, such as initial parameter values or changes in data samples, can propagate through the network, leading to different decisions during the learning process. As a result, even seemingly negligible randomness can amplify and manifest as considerable differences in the final output, as with the distinct features of the portraits.\nRandomness is not necessarily a bad thing – it mitigates overfitting and helps predictions to be generalised. However, it does present an additional barrier to reproducibility. If you cannot get the same results using the same raw materials – data, code, packages and computing environment – then you might have good reasons to doubt the validity of the findings.\nThere are many elements of an analysis in which randomness may be present and lead to different results. For example, in a classification (where your dependent variable is binary, e.g., success/failure with 1 and 0) or a regression (where your dependent variable is continuous, e.g., temperature measurements of 10.1°C, 2.8°C, etc.), you might need to split your data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to estimate the model (hyper)parameters and the testing set is used to compute the performance of the model. The way the split is usually operationalised is as a random selection of rows of your data. So, in principle, each time you split your data into training and testing sets, you may end up with different rows in each set. Differences in the training set may therefore lead to different values of the model (hyper)parameters and affect the predictive performance that is measured from the testing set. Also, differences in the testing set may lead to variations in the predictive performance scores, which in turn lead to potentially different interpretations and, ultimately, decisions if the results are used for that purpose.\nThis aspect of randomness in the training of models is relatively well known. But randomness may hide in other parts of code. One such example is illustrated below. Here, using Python, we set the seed number to 0 using np.random.seed(seed value). The random.seed() function from the package numpy (abbreviated np) saves the state of a random function so that it can create identical random numbers independently of the machine you use, and this is for any number of executions. A seed value is an initial input or starting point used by a pseudorandom number generator to generate a sequence of random numbers. It is often an integer or a timestamp. The number generator takes this seed value and uses it to produce a deterministic series of random numbers that appear to be random but can be recreated by using the same seed value. Without providing this seed value, the first execution of the function typically uses the current system time. The animation below generates two random arrays arr1 and arr2 using np.random.rand(3,2). Note that the values 3,2 indicate that we want random values for an array that has 3 rows and 2 columns.\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\n\n#Set the seed number e.g. to 0\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Set the seed number as before to get the same results\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nIf you run the code yourself multiple times, the values of arr1 and arr2 should remain identical. If this is not the case, check that the seed value is set to 0 in lines 4 and 11. These identical results are possible because we set the seed value to 0, which ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers each time the code is run. Now, let’s look at what happens if we remove the line np.random.seed(0):\n```{python}\n#Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nHere, the values of arr1 and arr2 will be different each time we run the code since the seed value was not set and is therefore changing over time.\nThis short code demonstrates how randomness that can be controlled by the seed value may affect your code. Therefore, unless randomness is required, e.g., to get some uncertainty in the results, setting the seed value will contribute to making your work reproducible. I also find it helpful to document the seed number I use in my code so that I can easily reproduce my findings in the future. If you are currently working on some code that involves random number generators, it might be worth checking your code and making all necessary changes. In our work (see code chunk 9 in the Jupyter notebook) we set the seed value in a general way, using a framework (config) so that our code always uses the same seed to train our algorithm."

We have explained why reproducibility matters and provided tips for how to achieve it – or, at least, work towards it. We have introduced a few important issues that you are likely to encounter on your own path to reproducibility. In sum, we have mentioned:\n\nThe importance of having relative instead of hard-coded paths in code.\nOperating system compatibility issues, which can be solved by using Docker containers for a consistent computing environment.\nThe convenience of Jupyter notebooks for code editing – particularly useful for data science projects and work using deep learning because of the ability to include text and code in the same document and make the work accessible to everyone (so long as they have an internet connection).\nThe need for version control using, for example, Git and GitHub, which allows you to keep track of changes in your code and collaborate with others efficiently.\nThe importance of setting the seed values in random number generators.\n\nThe graphic below provides a visual overview of the different components of our study and shows how each component works with the others to support reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use (A) the version control system, Git, and its hosting service, GitHub, which enables a team to share code with peers, efficiently track and synchronise code changes between local and server machines, and reset the project to a working state in case something breaks. Docker containers (B) include all necessary objects (engine, data, and scripts). Docker needs to be installed (plain-line arrows) by all users (project leader, collaborator(s), reviewer(s), and public user(s)) on their local machines (C); and (D) we use a user-friendly interface (JupyterLab) deployed from a local machine to facilitate the operations required to reproduce the work. The project leader and collaborators can edit (upload/download) the project files stored on the GitHub server (plain-line arrows) while reviewers and public users can only read the files (dotted-line arrows).\nNow, it is over to you.

    "text": "Reproducibility, or “the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as the original investigator”, is critical for sharing and building upon scientific findings. Reproducibility not only verifies the correctness of processes leading to results but also serves as a prerequisite for assessing generalisability to other datasets or contexts. This we refer to as replicability, or “the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but new data are collected”. Reproducibility, which is the focus of our work here, can be challenging – especially in the context of deep learning. This article, and associated material, aims to provide practical advice for overcoming these challenges.\nOur story begins with Davit Svanidze, a master’s degree student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). Davit’s efforts to make his bachelor’s thesis reproducible are what inspires this article, and we hope that readers will be able to learn from Davit’s experience and apply those learnings to their own work. Davit will demonstrate the use of Jupyter notebooks, GitHub, and other relevant tools to ensure reproducibility. He will walk us through code documentation, data management, and version control with Git. And, he will share best practices for collaboration, peer review, and dissemination of results.\nDavit’s story starts here, but there is much more for the interested reader to discover. At certain points in this article, we will direct readers to other resources, namely a Jupyter notebook and GitHub repository which contain all the instructions, data and code necessary to reproduce Davit’s research. Together, these components offer a comprehensive overview of the thought process and technical implementation required for reproducibility. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, the principles remain consistent."

    "text": "Davit’s journey towards reproducibility\n\nMore power, please\nThe focus of my bachelor’s thesis was to better understand the initial spread of Covid-19 in China using deep learning algorithms. I was keen to make my work reproducible, but not only for my own sake. The “reproducibility crisis” is a well-documented problem in science as a whole,1 2 3 4 with studies suggesting that around one-third of social science studies published between the years 2010 and 2015 in top journals like Nature and Science could not be reproduced.5 Results that cannot be reproduced are not necessarily “wrong”. But, if findings cannot be reproduced, we cannot be sure of their validity.\nFor my own research project, I gathered all data and started working on my computer. After I built the algorithms to train the data, my first challenge to reproducibility was computational. I realised that training models on my local computer was taking far too long, and I needed a faster, more powerful solution to be able to submit my thesis in time. Fortunately, I could access the university server to train the algorithms. Once the training was complete, I could generate the results on my local computer, since producing maps and tables was not so demanding. However…\n\n\nBloody paths!\nIn switching between machines and computing environments, I soon encountered an issue with my code: the paths, or file directory locations, for the trained algorithms had been hardcoded! As I quickly discovered, hardcoding a path can lead to issues when the code is run in a different environment, as the path might not exist in the new environment.\nAs my code became longer, I overlooked the path names linked to algorithms that were generating the results. This mistake – which would have been easily corrected if spotted earlier – resulted in incorrect outputs. Such errors could have enormous (negative) implications in a public health context, where evidence-based decisions have real impacts on human lives. It was at this point that I realised that my code is the fundamental pillar of the validity of my empirical work. How can someone trust my work if they are not able to verify it?\nThe following dummy code demonstrates the hardcoding issue:\n```{python}\n# Hardcoded path\nfile_path = \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\"\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nIn the code above, a dummy file (toydata.csv) is used. The dummy file contains data on the prices of three different toys, but only the path of the file is relevant to this example. If the hardcoded file path – \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\" – exists on the machine being used, the code will run just fine. But, when run in a different environment without said path, the code will result in a \"File not found error\". Better code that uses relative paths can be written as:\n```{python}\n# Relative path\nimport os\n\nfile_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"toydata.csv\")\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nYou can see that this code has successfully imported data from the dataset toydata.csv and printed its two columns (toy and price) and three rows.\nThe following example is a simplified version of what happened when I wrote code to train several models, store the results and run a procedure to compare results with the predictive performance of a benchmark model:\n```{python}\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\"}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\"}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model1.csv', index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Load the model result and compare with benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model\nresult = pd.read_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model2.csv').iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nEverything looks fine at a glance. But, if you examine the code carefully, you may spot the problem. Initially, when I coded the procedure (training the model, saving and loading the results), I hardcoded the paths and had to change them for each tested model. First, I trained model2, a complex model, and tested it against the benchmark (70 > 50 → accepted). I repeated the procedure for model1 (a simple model). Its result was identical to model2, therefore I kept model1 following the parsimony principle.\nHowever, for the code line loading the result for the current model (line 5, second cell), I forgot to amend the path and so mistakenly loaded the result of model2. As a consequence, I accepted a model which should have been rejected. These wrong results were then spread further in the code, including all charts and maps and the conclusions of my analysis.\nA small coding error like this can therefore be fatal to an analysis. Below is the corrected code:\n```{python}\nimport os\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details (INCLUDING PATHS) in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model1.csv\")}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model2.csv\")}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv(current_model[\"path\"], index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Get the model result and compare with the benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model WITH a VARIABLE PATH\nresult = pd.read_csv(current_model[\"path\"]).iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nHere, the paths are stored with other model details (line 7–8, first cell). Therefore, we can use them as variables when we need them (e.g., line 16, first cell, and line 5, second cell). Now, when the current model is set to model1 (line 11, first cell), everything is automatically adjusted. Also, if the path details need to be changed, we only need to change them once and everything else is automatically adjusted and updated. The code now correctly states that model1 performs worse than the benchmark and is therefore rejected and we should keep model2, which performs best.\nI managed to catch this error in time, but it often can be difficult to spot our own mistakes. That is why making code available to others is crucial. A code review by a second (or third) pair of eyes can save everyone a lot of time and avoid spreading incorrect results and conclusions.\n\n\nSolving compatibility chaos with Docker\nOne might think that it would be easy to copy code from one computer to another and run it without difficulties, but it turns out to be a real headache. Different operating systems on my local computer and the university server caused multiple compatibility issues and it was very time-consuming to try to solve them. The university server was running on Ubuntu, a Linux distribution, which was not compatible with my macOS-based code editor. Moreover, the server did not support the Python programming language – and all the deep learning algorithm packages that I needed – in the same way as my macOS computer did.\nAs a remedy, I used Docker containers, which allowed me to create a virtual environment with all the necessary packages and dependencies installed. This way, I could integrate them with different hardware and use the processing power of that hardware. To get started with Docker, I first had to install it on my local computer. The installation process is straightforward and the Docker website provides step-by-step instructions for different operating systems. In fact, I found the Docker website very helpful, with lots of resources and tutorials available. Once Docker was installed, it was easy to create virtual environments for my project and work with my code, libraries, and packages, without any compatibility issues. Not only did Docker containers save me a lot of time and effort, but they could also make it easier for others to reproduce my work.\nBelow is an example of a Dockerfile which recreates an environment with Python 3.7 on Linux. It describes what, how, when and in which order operations should be carried out to generate the environment with all Python packages required to run the main Python script, main.py.\n\n\nAn example of a Dockerfile.\n\nIn this example, by downloading the project, including the Dockerfile, anyone can run main.py without installing packages or worrying about what OS was used for development or which Python version should be installed. You can view Docker as a great robot chef: show it a recipe (Dockerfile), provide the ingredients (project files), push the start button (to build the container) and wait to sample the results.\n\n\nWhy does nobody check your code?\nEven after implementing Docker, I still faced another challenge to reproducibility: making the verification process for my code easy enough that it could be done by anyone, without them needing a degree in computer science! Increasingly, there is an expectation for researchers to share their code so that results can be reproduced, but there are as yet no widely accepted or enforced standards on how to make code readable and reusable. However, if we are to embrace the concept of reproducibility, we must write and publish code under the assumption that someone, somewhere – boss, team member, journal reviewer, reader – will want to rerun our code. And, if we expect that someone will want to rerun our code (and hopefully check it), we should ensure that the code is readable and does not take too long to run.\nIf your code does take too long to run, some operations can often be accelerated – for example, by reducing the size of the datasets or by implementing computationally efficient data processing approaches (e.g., using PyTorch). Aim for a running time of a few minutes – or about as long as it takes to make a cup of tea or coffee. Of course, if data needs to be reduced to save computational time, the person rerunning your code won’t generate the same results as in your original analysis. This therefore will not lead to reproducibility, sensu stricto. However, as long as you state clearly what are the expected results from the reduced dataset, your peers can at least inspect your code and offer feedback, and this marks a step towards reproducibility.\nWe should also make sure our code is free from bugs – both the kind that might lead to errors in analysis and also those that stop the code running to completion. Bugs can occur for various reasons. For example, some code chunks written on a Windows machine may not properly execute on a macOS machine because the former uses \\ for file paths, while the latter uses /:\n```{python}\n# Path works on macOS/Linux\nwith open(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n\n# Path works only on Windows    \nwith open(r\"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n   print(f.read())\n```\n\nHere, only the macOS/Linux version works, since the code this capture was taken from was implemented on a Linux server. There are alternatives, however. The code below works on macOS, Linux, and also Windows machines:\n```{python}\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Path works on every OS: macOS/Linux/Windows\n# It will automatically replace the path to \"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\" when it runs on Windows\nwith open(Path(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\"), \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n```\n\nThe extra Python package, pathlib, is of course unnecessary if you build a Docker container for your project, as discussed in the previous section.\n\n\nJupyter, King of the Notebooks\nBy this stage in my project, I was feeling that I’d made good progress towards ensuring that my work would be reproducible. I’d expended a lot of effort to make my code readable, efficient, and also absent of bugs (or, at least, this is what I was hoping for). I’d also built a Docker container to allow others to replicate my computing environment and rerun the analysis. Still, I wanted to make sure there were no barriers that would prevent people – my supervisors, in particular – from being able to review the work I had done for my undergraduate thesis. What I wanted was a way to present a complete narrative of my project that was easy to understand and follow. For this, I turned to Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nJupyter notebooks combine Markdown text, code, and visualisations. The notebook itself can sit within an online directory of folders and files that contain all the data and code related to a project, allowing readers to understand the processes behind the work and also access the raw resources. From the notebook I produced, readers can see exactly what I did, how I did it, and what my results were.\nWhile creating my notebook, I was able to experiment with my code and iterate quickly. Code cells within a document can be run interactively, which allowed me to try out different approaches to solving a problem and see the results almost in real time. I could also get feedback from others and try out new ideas without having to spend a lot of time writing and debugging code.\n\n\nVersion control with Git and GitHub\nMy Jupyter notebook and associated folders and files are all available via GitHub. Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a central repository for storing and sharing code. With Git and GitHub, I was able to version my code and collaborate with others without the risk of losing any work. I really couldn’t afford to redo the entire year I spent on my dissertation!\nGit and GitHub are great for reproducibility. By sharing code via these platforms, others can access your work, verify it and reproduce your results without risking changing or, worse, destroying your work – whether partially or completely. These tools also make it easy for others to build on your work if they want to further develop your research. You can also use Git and GitHub to share or promote your results across a wider community. The ability to easily store and share your code also makes it easy to keep track of the different versions of your code and to see how your work has evolved.\nThe following illustration shows the tracking of very simple changes in a Python file. The previous version of the code is shown on the left; the new version is shown on the right. Additions and deletions are highlighted in green and red, and with + and - symbols, respectively.\n\n\nA simple example of GitHub version tracking."

    "text": "The deep learning challenge\nSo far, this article has dealt with barriers to reproducibility – and ways around them – that will apply to most, if not all, modern research projects. While I’d encourage any scientist to adopt these practices in their own work, it is important to stress that these alone cannot guarantee reproducibility. In cases where standard statistical procedures are used within statistical software packages, reproducibility is often achievable. However, in reality, even when following the same procedures, differences in outputs can occur, and identifying the reasons for this may be challenging. Cooking offers a simple analogy: subtle changes in room temperature or ingredient quality from one day to the next can impact the final product.\nOne of the challenges for research projects employing machine learning and deep learning algorithms is that outputs can be influenced by the randomness that is inherent in these approaches. Consider the four portraits below, generated by the Midjourney bot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nEach portrait looks broadly similar at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, critical differences emerge. These differences arise because deep learning models rely on numerous interconnected layers to learn intricate patterns and representations. Slight random perturbations, such as initial parameter values or changes in data samples, can propagate through the network, leading to different decisions during the learning process. As a result, even seemingly negligible randomness can amplify and manifest as considerable differences in the final output, as with the distinct features of the portraits.\nRandomness is not necessarily a bad thing – it mitigates overfitting and helps predictions to be generalised. However, it does present an additional barrier to reproducibility. If you cannot get the same results using the same raw materials – data, code, packages and computing environment – then you might have good reasons to doubt the validity of the findings.\nThere are many elements of an analysis in which randomness may be present and lead to different results. For example, in a classification (where your dependent variable is binary, e.g., success/failure with 1 and 0) or a regression (where your dependent variable is continuous, e.g., temperature measurements of 10.1°C, 2.8°C, etc.), you might need to split your data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to estimate the model (hyper)parameters and the testing set is used to compute the performance of the model. The way the split is usually operationalised is as a random selection of rows of your data. So, in principle, each time you split your data into training and testing sets, you may end up with different rows in each set. Differences in the training set may therefore lead to different values of the model (hyper)parameters and affect the predictive performance that is measured from the testing set. Also, differences in the testing set may lead to variations in the predictive performance scores, which in turn lead to potentially different interpretations and, ultimately, decisions if the results are used for that purpose.\nThis aspect of randomness in the training of models is relatively well known. But randomness may hide in other parts of code. One such example is illustrated below. Here, using Python, we set the seed number to 0 using np.random.seed(seed value). The random.seed() function from the package numpy (abbreviated np) saves the state of a random function so that it can create identical random numbers independently of the machine you use, and this is for any number of executions. A seed value is an initial input or starting point used by a pseudorandom number generator to generate a sequence of random numbers. It is often an integer or a timestamp. The number generator takes this seed value and uses it to produce a deterministic series of random numbers that appear to be random but can be recreated by using the same seed value. Without providing this seed value, the first execution of the function typically uses the current system time. The animation below generates two random arrays arr1 and arr2 using np.random.rand(3,2). Note that the values 3,2 indicate that we want random values for an array that has 3 rows and 2 columns.\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\n\n#Set the seed number e.g. to 0\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Set the seed number as before to get the same results\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nIf you run the code yourself multiple times, the values of arr1 and arr2 should remain identical. If this is not the case, check that the seed value is set to 0 in lines 4 and 11. These identical results are possible because we set the seed value to 0, which ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers each time the code is run. Now, let’s look at what happens if we remove the line np.random.seed(0):\n```{python}\n#Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nHere, the values of arr1 and arr2 will be different each time we run the code since the seed value was not set and is therefore changing over time.\nThis short code demonstrates how randomness that can be controlled by the seed value may affect your code. Therefore, unless randomness is required, e.g., to get some uncertainty in the results, setting the seed value will contribute to making your work reproducible. I also find it helpful to document the seed number I use in my code so that I can easily reproduce my findings in the future. If you are currently working on some code that involves random number generators, it might be worth checking your code and making all necessary changes. In our work (see code chunk 9 in the Jupyter notebook) we set the seed value in a general way, using a framework (config) so that our code always uses the same seed to train our algorithm."

We have explained why reproducibility matters and provided tips for how to achieve it – or, at least, work towards it. We have introduced a few important issues that you are likely to encounter on your own path to reproducibility. In sum, we have mentioned:\n\nThe importance of having relative instead of hard-coded paths in code.\nOperating system compatibility issues, which can be solved by using Docker containers for a consistent computing environment.\nThe convenience of Jupyter notebooks for code editing – particularly useful for data science projects and work using deep learning because of the ability to include text and code in the same document and make the work accessible to everyone (so long as they have an internet connection).\nThe need for version control using, for example, Git and GitHub, which allows you to keep track of changes in your code and collaborate with others efficiently.\nThe importance of setting the seed values in random number generators.\n\nThe graphic below provides a visual overview of the different components of our study and shows how each component works with the others to support reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use (A) the version control system, Git, and its hosting service, GitHub, which enables a team to share code with peers, efficiently track and synchronise code changes between local and server machines, and reset the project to a working state in case something breaks. Docker containers (B) include all necessary objects (engine, data, and scripts). Docker needs to be installed (plain-line arrows) by all users (project leader, collaborator(s), reviewer(s), and public user(s)) on their local machines (C); and (D) we use a user-friendly interface (JupyterLab) deployed from a local machine to facilitate the operations required to reproduce the work. The project leader and collaborators can edit (upload/download) the project files stored on the GitHub server (plain-line arrows) while reviewers and public users can only read the files (dotted-line arrows).\nNow, it is over to you. Our Jupyter notebook provides a walkthrough of our research. Our GitHub repository has all the data, code and other files you need to reproduce our work, and this README file will help you get started.\nAnd with that, we wish you all the best on the road to reproducibility!\n\nFind more case studies\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the authors\n\nDavit Svanidze is a master’s degree student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE).

    "text": "Reproducibility, or “the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as the original investigator”, is critical for sharing and building upon scientific findings. Reproducibility not only verifies the correctness of processes leading to results but also serves as a prerequisite for assessing generalisability to other datasets or contexts. This we refer to as replicability, or “the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but new data are collected”. Reproducibility, which is the focus of our work here, can be challenging – especially in the context of deep learning. This article, and associated material, aims to provide practical advice for overcoming these challenges.\nOur story begins with Davit Svanidze, a master’s degree student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). Davit’s efforts to make his bachelor’s thesis reproducible are what inspires this article, and we hope that readers will be able to learn from Davit’s experience and apply those learnings to their own work. Davit will demonstrate the use of Jupyter notebooks, GitHub, and other relevant tools to ensure reproducibility. He will walk us through code documentation, data management, and version control with Git. And, he will share best practices for collaboration, peer review, and dissemination of results.\nDavit’s story starts here, but there is much more for the interested reader to discover. At certain points in this article, we will direct readers to other resources, namely a Jupyter notebook and GitHub repository which contain all the instructions, data and code necessary to reproduce Davit’s research. Together, these components offer a comprehensive overview of the thought process and technical implementation required for reproducibility. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, the principles remain consistent."

    "text": "Davit’s journey towards reproducibility\n\nMore power, please\nThe focus of my bachelor’s thesis was to better understand the initial spread of Covid-19 in China using deep learning algorithms. I was keen to make my work reproducible, but not only for my own sake. The “reproducibility crisis” is a well-documented problem in science as a whole,1 2 3 4 with studies suggesting that around one-third of social science studies published between the years 2010 and 2015 in top journals like Nature and Science could not be reproduced.5 Results that cannot be reproduced are not necessarily “wrong”. But, if findings cannot be reproduced, we cannot be sure of their validity.\nFor my own research project, I gathered all data and started working on my computer. After I built the algorithms to train the data, my first challenge to reproducibility was computational. I realised that training models on my local computer was taking far too long, and I needed a faster, more powerful solution to be able to submit my thesis in time. Fortunately, I could access the university server to train the algorithms. Once the training was complete, I could generate the results on my local computer, since producing maps and tables was not so demanding. However…\n\n\nBloody paths!\nIn switching between machines and computing environments, I soon encountered an issue with my code: the paths, or file directory locations, for the trained algorithms had been hardcoded! As I quickly discovered, hardcoding a path can lead to issues when the code is run in a different environment, as the path might not exist in the new environment.\nAs my code became longer, I overlooked the path names linked to algorithms that were generating the results. This mistake – which would have been easily corrected if spotted earlier – resulted in incorrect outputs. Such errors could have enormous (negative) implications in a public health context, where evidence-based decisions have real impacts on human lives. It was at this point that I realised that my code is the fundamental pillar of the validity of my empirical work. How can someone trust my work if they are not able to verify it?\nThe following dummy code demonstrates the hardcoding issue:\n```{python}\n# Hardcoded path\nfile_path = \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\"\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nIn the code above, a dummy file (toydata.csv) is used. The dummy file contains data on the prices of three different toys, but only the path of the file is relevant to this example. If the hardcoded file path – \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\" – exists on the machine being used, the code will run just fine. But, when run in a different environment without said path, the code will result in a \"File not found error\". Better code that uses relative paths can be written as:\n```{python}\n# Relative path\nimport os\n\nfile_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"toydata.csv\")\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nYou can see that this code has successfully imported data from the dataset toydata.csv and printed its two columns (toy and price) and three rows.\nThe following example is a simplified version of what happened when I wrote code to train several models, store the results and run a procedure to compare results with the predictive performance of a benchmark model:\n```{python}\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\"}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\"}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model1.csv', index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Load the model result and compare with benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model\nresult = pd.read_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model2.csv').iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nEverything looks fine at a glance. But, if you examine the code carefully, you may spot the problem. Initially, when I coded the procedure (training the model, saving and loading the results), I hardcoded the paths and had to change them for each tested model. First, I trained model2, a complex model, and tested it against the benchmark (70 > 50 → accepted). I repeated the procedure for model1 (a simple model). Its result was identical to model2, therefore I kept model1 following the parsimony principle.\nHowever, for the code line loading the result for the current model (line 5, second cell), I forgot to amend the path and so mistakenly loaded the result of model2. As a consequence, I accepted a model which should have been rejected. These wrong results were then spread further in the code, including all charts and maps and the conclusions of my analysis.\nA small coding error like this can therefore be fatal to an analysis. Below is the corrected code:\n```{python}\nimport os\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details (INCLUDING PATHS) in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model1.csv\")}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model2.csv\")}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv(current_model[\"path\"], index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Get the model result and compare with the benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model WITH a VARIABLE PATH\nresult = pd.read_csv(current_model[\"path\"]).iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nHere, the paths are stored with other model details (line 7–8, first cell). Therefore, we can use them as variables when we need them (e.g., line 16, first cell, and line 5, second cell). Now, when the current model is set to model1 (line 11, first cell), everything is automatically adjusted. Also, if the path details need to be changed, we only need to change them once and everything else is automatically adjusted and updated. The code now correctly states that model1 performs worse than the benchmark and is therefore rejected and we should keep model2, which performs best.\nI managed to catch this error in time, but it often can be difficult to spot our own mistakes. That is why making code available to others is crucial. A code review by a second (or third) pair of eyes can save everyone a lot of time and avoid spreading incorrect results and conclusions.\n\n\nSolving compatibility chaos with Docker\nOne might think that it would be easy to copy code from one computer to another and run it without difficulties, but it turns out to be a real headache. Different operating systems on my local computer and the university server caused multiple compatibility issues and it was very time-consuming to try to solve them. The university server was running on Ubuntu, a Linux distribution, which was not compatible with my macOS-based code editor. Moreover, the server did not support the Python programming language – and all the deep learning algorithm packages that I needed – in the same way as my macOS computer did.\nAs a remedy, I used Docker containers, which allowed me to create a virtual environment with all the necessary packages and dependencies installed. This way, I could integrate them with different hardware and use the processing power of that hardware. To get started with Docker, I first had to install it on my local computer. The installation process is straightforward and the Docker website provides step-by-step instructions for different operating systems. In fact, I found the Docker website very helpful, with lots of resources and tutorials available. Once Docker was installed, it was easy to create virtual environments for my project and work with my code, libraries, and packages, without any compatibility issues. Not only did Docker containers save me a lot of time and effort, but they could also make it easier for others to reproduce my work.\nBelow is an example of a Dockerfile which recreates an environment with Python 3.7 on Linux. It describes what, how, when and in which order operations should be carried out to generate the environment with all Python packages required to run the main Python script, main.py.\n\n\nAn example of a Dockerfile.\n\nIn this example, by downloading the project, including the Dockerfile, anyone can run main.py without installing packages or worrying about what OS was used for development or which Python version should be installed. You can view Docker as a great robot chef: show it a recipe (Dockerfile), provide the ingredients (project files), push the start button (to build the container) and wait to sample the results.\n\n\nWhy does nobody check your code?\nEven after implementing Docker, I still faced another challenge to reproducibility: making the verification process for my code easy enough that it could be done by anyone, without them needing a degree in computer science! Increasingly, there is an expectation for researchers to share their code so that results can be reproduced, but there are as yet no widely accepted or enforced standards on how to make code readable and reusable. However, if we are to embrace the concept of reproducibility, we must write and publish code under the assumption that someone, somewhere – boss, team member, journal reviewer, reader – will want to rerun our code. And, if we expect that someone will want to rerun our code (and hopefully check it), we should ensure that the code is readable and does not take too long to run.\nIf your code does take too long to run, some operations can often be accelerated – for example, by reducing the size of the datasets or by implementing computationally efficient data processing approaches (e.g., using PyTorch). Aim for a running time of a few minutes – or about as long as it takes to make a cup of tea or coffee. Of course, if data needs to be reduced to save computational time, the person rerunning your code won’t generate the same results as in your original analysis. This therefore will not lead to reproducibility, sensu stricto. However, as long as you state clearly what are the expected results from the reduced dataset, your peers can at least inspect your code and offer feedback, and this marks a step towards reproducibility.\nWe should also make sure our code is free from bugs – both the kind that might lead to errors in analysis and also those that stop the code running to completion. Bugs can occur for various reasons. For example, some code chunks written on a Windows machine may not properly execute on a macOS machine because the former uses \\ for file paths, while the latter uses /:\n```{python}\n# Path works on macOS/Linux\nwith open(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n\n# Path works only on Windows    \nwith open(r\"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n   print(f.read())\n```\n\nHere, only the macOS/Linux version works, since the code this capture was taken from was implemented on a Linux server. There are alternatives, however. The code below works on macOS, Linux, and also Windows machines:\n```{python}\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Path works on every OS: macOS/Linux/Windows\n# It will automatically replace the path to \"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\" when it runs on Windows\nwith open(Path(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\"), \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n```\n\nThe extra Python package, pathlib, is of course unnecessary if you build a Docker container for your project, as discussed in the previous section.\n\n\nJupyter, King of the Notebooks\nBy this stage in my project, I was feeling that I’d made good progress towards ensuring that my work would be reproducible. I’d expended a lot of effort to make my code readable, efficient, and also absent of bugs (or, at least, this is what I was hoping for). I’d also built a Docker container to allow others to replicate my computing environment and rerun the analysis. Still, I wanted to make sure there were no barriers that would prevent people – my supervisors, in particular – from being able to review the work I had done for my undergraduate thesis. What I wanted was a way to present a complete narrative of my project that was easy to understand and follow. For this, I turned to Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nJupyter notebooks combine Markdown text, code, and visualisations. The notebook itself can sit within an online directory of folders and files that contain all the data and code related to a project, allowing readers to understand the processes behind the work and also access the raw resources. From the notebook I produced, readers can see exactly what I did, how I did it, and what my results were.\nWhile creating my notebook, I was able to experiment with my code and iterate quickly. Code cells within a document can be run interactively, which allowed me to try out different approaches to solving a problem and see the results almost in real time. I could also get feedback from others and try out new ideas without having to spend a lot of time writing and debugging code.\n\n\nVersion control with Git and GitHub\nMy Jupyter notebook and associated folders and files are all available via GitHub. Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a central repository for storing and sharing code. With Git and GitHub, I was able to version my code and collaborate with others without the risk of losing any work. I really couldn’t afford to redo the entire year I spent on my dissertation!\nGit and GitHub are great for reproducibility. By sharing code via these platforms, others can access your work, verify it and reproduce your results without risking changing or, worse, destroying your work – whether partially or completely. These tools also make it easy for others to build on your work if they want to further develop your research. You can also use Git and GitHub to share or promote your results across a wider community. The ability to easily store and share your code also makes it easy to keep track of the different versions of your code and to see how your work has evolved.\nThe following illustration shows the tracking of very simple changes in a Python file. The previous version of the code is shown on the left; the new version is shown on the right. Additions and deletions are highlighted in green and red, and with + and - symbols, respectively.\n\n\nA simple example of GitHub version tracking."

    "text": "The deep learning challenge\nSo far, this article has dealt with barriers to reproducibility – and ways around them – that will apply to most, if not all, modern research projects. While I’d encourage any scientist to adopt these practices in their own work, it is important to stress that these alone cannot guarantee reproducibility. In cases where standard statistical procedures are used within statistical software packages, reproducibility is often achievable. However, in reality, even when following the same procedures, differences in outputs can occur, and identifying the reasons for this may be challenging. Cooking offers a simple analogy: subtle changes in room temperature or ingredient quality from one day to the next can impact the final product.\nOne of the challenges for research projects employing machine learning and deep learning algorithms is that outputs can be influenced by the randomness that is inherent in these approaches. Consider the four portraits below, generated by the Midjourney bot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nEach portrait looks broadly similar at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, critical differences emerge. These differences arise because deep learning models rely on numerous interconnected layers to learn intricate patterns and representations. Slight random perturbations, such as initial parameter values or changes in data samples, can propagate through the network, leading to different decisions during the learning process. As a result, even seemingly negligible randomness can amplify and manifest as considerable differences in the final output, as with the distinct features of the portraits.\nRandomness is not necessarily a bad thing – it mitigates overfitting and helps predictions to be generalised. However, it does present an additional barrier to reproducibility. If you cannot get the same results using the same raw materials – data, code, packages and computing environment – then you might have good reasons to doubt the validity of the findings.\nThere are many elements of an analysis in which randomness may be present and lead to different results. For example, in a classification (where your dependent variable is binary, e.g., success/failure with 1 and 0) or a regression (where your dependent variable is continuous, e.g., temperature measurements of 10.1°C, 2.8°C, etc.), you might need to split your data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to estimate the model (hyper)parameters and the testing set is used to compute the performance of the model. The way the split is usually operationalised is as a random selection of rows of your data. So, in principle, each time you split your data into training and testing sets, you may end up with different rows in each set. Differences in the training set may therefore lead to different values of the model (hyper)parameters and affect the predictive performance that is measured from the testing set. Also, differences in the testing set may lead to variations in the predictive performance scores, which in turn lead to potentially different interpretations and, ultimately, decisions if the results are used for that purpose.\nThis aspect of randomness in the training of models is relatively well known. But randomness may hide in other parts of code. One such example is illustrated below. Here, using Python, we set the seed number to 0 using np.random.seed(seed value). The random.seed() function from the package numpy (abbreviated np) saves the state of a random function so that it can create identical random numbers independently of the machine you use, and this is for any number of executions. A seed value is an initial input or starting point used by a pseudorandom number generator to generate a sequence of random numbers. It is often an integer or a timestamp. The number generator takes this seed value and uses it to produce a deterministic series of random numbers that appear to be random but can be recreated by using the same seed value. Without providing this seed value, the first execution of the function typically uses the current system time. The animation below generates two random arrays arr1 and arr2 using np.random.rand(3,2). Note that the values 3,2 indicate that we want random values for an array that has 3 rows and 2 columns.\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\n\n#Set the seed number e.g. to 0\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Set the seed number as before to get the same results\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nIf you run the code yourself multiple times, the values of arr1 and arr2 should remain identical. If this is not the case, check that the seed value is set to 0 in lines 4 and 11. These identical results are possible because we set the seed value to 0, which ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers each time the code is run. Now, let’s look at what happens if we remove the line np.random.seed(0):\n```{python}\n#Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nHere, the values of arr1 and arr2 will be different each time we run the code since the seed value was not set and is therefore changing over time.\nThis short code demonstrates how randomness that can be controlled by the seed value may affect your code. Therefore, unless randomness is required, e.g., to get some uncertainty in the results, setting the seed value will contribute to making your work reproducible. I also find it helpful to document the seed number I use in my code so that I can easily reproduce my findings in the future. If you are currently working on some code that involves random number generators, it might be worth checking your code and making all necessary changes. In our work (see code chunk 9 in the Jupyter notebook) we set the seed value in a general way, using a framework (config) so that our code always uses the same seed to train our algorithm."

    "text": "Conclusion\nWe hope you have enjoyed learning more about our quest for reproducibility. We have explained why reproducibility matters and provided tips for how to achieve it – or, at least, work towards it. We have introduced a few important issues that you are likely to encounter on your own path to reproducibility. In sum, we have mentioned:\n\nThe importance of having relative instead of hard-coded paths in code.\nOperating system compatibility issues, which can be solved by using Docker containers for a consistent computing environment.\nThe convenience of Jupyter notebooks for code editing – particularly useful for data science projects and work using deep learning because of the ability to include text and code in the same document and make the work accessible to everyone (so long as they have an internet connection).\nThe need for version control using, for example, Git and GitHub, which allows you to keep track of changes in your code and collaborate with others efficiently.\nThe importance of setting the seed values in random number generators.\n\nThe graphic below provides a visual overview of the different components of our study and shows how each component works with the others to support reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use (A) the version control system, Git, and its hosting service, GitHub, which enables a team to share code with peers, efficiently track and synchronise code changes between local and server machines, and reset the project to a working state in case something breaks. Docker containers (B) include all necessary objects (engine, data, and scripts). Docker needs to be installed (plain-line arrows) by all users (project leader, collaborator(s), reviewer(s), and public user(s)) on their local machines (C); and (D) we use a user-friendly interface (JupyterLab) deployed from a local machine to facilitate the operations required to reproduce the work. The project leader and collaborators can edit (upload/download) the project files stored on the GitHub server (plain-line arrows) while reviewers and public users can only read the files (dotted-line arrows).\nNow, it is over to you. Our Jupyter notebook provides a walkthrough of our research. Our GitHub repository has all the data, code and other files you need to reproduce our work, and this README file will help you get started.\nAnd with that, we wish you all the best on the road to reproducibility!\n\nFind more case studies\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the authors\n\nDavit Svanidze is a master’s degree student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE).

Candidates that were taller than their opponents received more popular votes, although they were not significantly more likely to win the actual election. Taller presidents were also more likely to be reelected. In addition, presidents were, on average, much taller than men from the same birth cohort.

Methods: We used data from a long‐term study of 5,326 female Wisconsin high school graduates to examine the association between female height and reproductive success. Twenty‐one samples on this association were covered by our literature review. Results: Shorter women had more children surviving to age 18 than taller women, despite increased child mortality in shorter women. Taller women had a higher age at first birth and age at first marriage and reached a higher social status, but the negative effect of height on reproductive success persisted after controlling for these variables. However, while these effects were quite consistent in Western populations, they were not consistently present in non‐Western populations. Our review also indicated that child mortality was almost universally higher among shorter women. Conclusions: We conclude that shorter women have a higher number of live births but that final reproductive success depends on the positive effect of height on child survival.”\nauthors = [“Gert Stulp”, “Simon Verhulst”, “Thomas V.

We hypothesize that this is because the advantages associated with taller stature accrue mainly from not being short, rather than from being taller than average. Lower fertility by short men may be a consequence of their and their partner’s lower scores on aspects of mate quality. Taller men, although they score higher on mate quality compared to average height men, may have lower fertility because they are more likely to be paired with taller women, who are potentially less fertile. Methods: We analyzed data from The Integrated Health Interview Series (IHIS) of the United States (N = 165,606). Segmented regression was used to examine patterns across the height continuum. Results: On all aspects of own and partner quality, shorter men scored lower than both average height and taller men. Height more strongly predicted these aspects when moving from short to average height, than when moving from average to taller heights. Women of a given height who scored lower on mate quality also had shorter partners. Conclusions: Shorter men faced a double disadvantage with respect to both their own mate quality and that of their spouses. Scores of taller men were only marginally higher than those of average height men, suggesting that being tall is less important than not being short.

Although we know much about human height, this information has rarely been brought together in a comprehensive, systematic fashion. Here, we present a synthetic review of the literature on human height from an explicit evolutionary perspective, addressing its phylogenetic history, development, and environmental and genetic influences on growth and stature. In addition to presenting evidence to suggest the past action of natural selection on human height, we also assess the evidence that natural and sexual selection continues to act on height in contemporary populations. Although there is clear evidence to suggest that selection acts on height, mainly through life‐history processes but perhaps also directly, it is also apparent that methodological factors reduce the confidence with which such inferences can be drawn, and there remain surprising gaps in our knowledge.

Antonyms and but co-occurred in only 1% of the 218,017 sentences studied. However, in 81% of but marked sentences with true antonyms pairs, the feature the antonyms described was a source of the contrast. In the non-but marked sentences, antonymy alone was a poor predictor, licensing a contrast in only 15% of the cases.

    "text": "+++ abstract = “Does evolutionary theorizing have a role in psychology? This is a more contentious issue than one might imagine, given that, as evolved creatures, the answer must surely be yes. The contested nature of evolutionary psychology lies not in our status as evolved beings, but in the extent to which evolutionary ideas add value to studies of human behavior, and the rigor with which these ideas are tested. This, in turn, is linked to the framework in which particular evolutionary ideas are situated. While the framing of the current research topic places the brain-as-computer metaphor in opposition to evolutionary psychology, the most prominent school of thought in this field (born out of cognitive psychology, and often known as the Santa Barbara school) is entirely wedded to the computational theory of mind as an explanatory framework. Its unique aspect is to argue that the mind consists of a large number of functionally specialized (i.e., domain-specific) computational mechanisms, or modules (the massive modularity hypothesis). Far from offering an alternative to, or an improvement on, the current perspective, we argue that evolutionary psychology is a mainstream computational theory, and that its arguments for domain-specificity often rest on shaky premises. We then go on to suggest that the various forms of e-cognition (i.e., embodied, embedded, enactive) represent a true alternative to standard computational approaches, with an emphasis on “cognitive integration” or the “extended mind hypothesis” in particular.

This secular trend in height is echoed across allWestern populations, but came to an end, or at least levelled off, much earlier than in The Netherlands. One possibility, then, is that natural selection acted congruently with these environmentally induced changes to further promote tall stature among the people of the lowlands. Using data from the LifeLines study, which follows a large sample of the population of the north of The Netherlands (n = 94 516), we examined how height was related to measures of reproductive success (as a proxy for fitness). Across three decades (1935–1967), height was consistently related to reproductive output (number of children born and number of surviving children), favouring taller men and average height women. This was despite a later age at first birth for taller individuals. Furthermore, even in this low-mortality population, taller women experienced higher child survival, which contributed positively to their increased reproductive success. Thus,natural selection in addition to good environmental conditions may help explain why the Dutch are so tall.”\nauthors = [“Gert Stulp”, “Louise Barrett”, “Felix C Tropf”, “Melinda C Mills”] date = “2014-05-15” image_preview = “” math = true publication_types = [“2”] publication = “In Proceedings of the Royal Society B” publication_short = “Proceedings” selected = false title = “Does natural selection favour taller stature among the tallest people on earth?” url_code = “” url_dataset = “” url_pdf = “pdf/2015_Stulp_et_al_Proceedings_Height_Netherlands.pdf” url_project = “” url_slides = “” url_video = “”\n[[url_custom]] name = “View Journal Article” url = “http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1806/20150211.long”\n\nOptional featured image (relative to static/img/ folder).\n[header] image = “” caption = “”\n+++"

This question has been the subject of a highly contentious debate, beginning in the late 1980s and continuing to this day. Researchers in both evolutionary and social sciences have argued that the measurement of fitness-related traits (e.g., fertility) offers little insight into evolutionary processes, on the grounds that modern industrial environments differ so greatly from those of our ancestral past that our behavior can no longer be expected to be adaptive. In contrast, we argue that fertility measurements in industrial society are essential for a complete evolutionary analysis: in particular, such data can provide evidence for any putative adaptive mismatch between ancestral environments and those of the present day, and they can provide insight into the selection pressures currently operating on contemporary populations. Having made this positive case, we then go on to discuss some challenges of fertility-related analyses among industrialized populations, particularly those that involve large-scale databases. These include ‘researcher degrees of freedom’ (i.e., the choices made about which variables to analyze and how) and the different biases that may exist in such data. Despite these concerns, large datasets from multiple populations represent an excellent opportunity to test evolutionary hypotheses in great detail, enriching the evolutionary understanding of human behavior.”\nauthors = [“Gert Stulp”, “Rebecca Sear”, “Louise Barrett”] date = “2016-09-26” image_preview = “” math = true publication_types = [“2”] publication = “In Human Nature” publication_short = “” selected = false title = “The Reproductive Ecology of Industrial Societies, Part I: Why Measuring Fertility Matters” url_code = “” url_dataset = “” url_pdf = “https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12110-016-9269-4” url_project = “” url_slides = “” url_video = “”\n[[url_custom]] name = “View Journal Article” url = “https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12110-016-9269-4”\n\nOptional featured image (relative to static/img/ folder).\n[header] image = “” caption = “”\n+++"

We show that sexual conflict at the level of preferences is translated into choice: women were most likely to choose a speed-dater 25 cm taller than themselves, whereas men were most likely to choose women only 7 cm shorter than themselves. As a consequence, matches were most likely at an intermediate height difference (19 cm) that differed significantly from the preferred height difference of both sexes.

This papers reviews 152 studies resulting in 137 estimates for the mean of preferred number of children, 104 estimates for the proportions of different numbers of children preferred and 66 estimates for the second-child preferences. We found that after the long-time decline of fertility preferences in the last century, the average family size remained at a low level but started to increase slowly since 2001. This upturn was observed for all three types of measurements of fertility preferences: ideal, desired, and planned family size. The results also indicate a strong two-child preference (more than 50% of respondents) in China, although 30% of people prefer one child and only a small fraction indicating an ideal family size for three or more children. Results on people’s preference for a second child were less consistent. We concluded that fertility is unlikely to increase rapidly in China even when the government adopts more relaxed family planning policy. Because the upward trend in fertility preferences was very minimal and the economic constraints will prevent many people to realise their preferences.”\nauthors = [“Rui Lu”, “Anne Gauthier”, “Gert Stulp”] date = “2023-03-07” image_preview = “” math = true publication_types = [“2”] publication = “Journal of Population Research” publication_short = “” selected = false title = “Fertility preferences in China in the twenty-first century” url_code = “” url_dataset = “” url_pdf = “https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12546-023-09303-0” url_project = “” url_slides = “” url_video = “”\n\nOptional featured image (relative to static/img/ folder).\n[header] image = “” caption = “”\n+++"

When the jays could be heard, but not seen, by a competitor, they cached proportionally less food items in the ‘noisy’ substrate than when they cached alone in the room, or when they could be seen and heard by competitors.

    "text": "+++ abstract = “Background: Social interactions are important for well-being, and therefore, researchers are increasingly attempting to capture people’s social environment. Many different disciplines have developed tools to measure the social environment, which can be highly variable over time. The experience sampling method (ESM) is often used in psychology to study the dynamics within a person and the social environment. In addition, passive sensing is often used to capture social behavior via sensors from smartphones or other wearable devices. Furthermore, sociologists use egocentric networks to track how social relationships are changing. Each of these methods is likely to tap into different but important parts of people’s social environment. Thus far, the development and implementation of these methods have occurred mostly separately from each other. Objective: Our aim was to synthesize the literature on how these methods are currently used to capture the changing social environment in relation to well-being and assess how to best combine these methods to study well-being. Methods: We conducted a scoping review according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results: We included 275 studies. In total, 3 important points follow from our review. First, each method captures a different but important part of the social environment at a different temporal resolution. Second, measures are rarely validated (&gt;70% of ESM studies and 50% of passive sensing studies were not validated), which undermines the robustness of the conclusions drawn.

Previously it has been shown that the likelihood of a delivery via ECS is positively associated with the birth weight and size of the newborn and negatively with maternal height. Paternal height affects skeletal growth and mass of the fetus, and thus might also affect pregnancy outcomes. We hypothesized that the effect of newborn birth weight on the risk of ECS would decrease with increasing maternal height. Similarly, we predicted that there would be an increase in ECS risk as a function of paternal height, but that this effect would be relative to maternal height (i.e., parental height differences). We used data from the Millennium Cohort Study: a large-scale survey (N = 18,819 births) with data on babies born and their parents from the United Kingdom surveyed 9 to 12-months after birth. We found that in primiparous women, both maternal height and parental height differences interacted with birth weight and predicted the likelihood of an ECS. When carrying a heavy newborn, the risk of ECS was more than doubled for short women (46.3%) compared to tall women (21.7%), in agreement with earlier findings. For women of average height carrying a heavy newborn while having a relatively short compared to tall partner reduced the risk by 6.7%. In conclusion, the size of the baby, the height of the mother and parental height differences affect the likelihood of an ECS in primiparous women.”\nauthors = [“Gert Stulp”, “Simon Verhulst”, “Thomas V.

Given its high heritability, IASC over human height is likely. Using data from sibling pairs from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, we present evidence for IASC over height: in shorter sibling pairs (relatively) more reproductive success (number of children) was obtained through the sister than through the brother of the sibling pair.

Women prefer, on average, a larger height difference between themselves and their partner (i.e. males being much taller than themselves) than men do. This effect is even more pronounced when examining satisfaction with actual partner height: women are most satisfied when their partner was 21 cm taller, whereas men are most satisfied when they were 8 cm taller than their partner. Next, using data from our sample and that of a previously published study (N = 52,677), we show that for men, height is more important to the expression of satisfaction with one’s own height than it is for women.

We find that higher educational attainment and LFP are positively associated with childlessness.

In contrast, we find that among women who ultimately remain childless, those women who work fulltime and have higher status occupations have higher expectations to have children throughout their life course. These results suggest that education and occupation produce constraints, resulting in the postponement of childbearing which hinders women in realizing their desires and expectations.

Here we report on male and female height preferences in two non-Western populations—the Hadza (Tanzania) and the Tsimane’ (Bolivia)—and the relationships between body height preferences and the height of actual partners. In the Hadza, most individuals preferred a sexual dimorphism in stature (SDS) with the man being much taller than the woman. Preferences for SDS and actual partner SDS were positively and significantly correlated in both men and women, suggesting that people who preferred larger height differences also had larger height differences with their partners. In the Tsimane’, the majority of men preferred an SDS with the man being taller than the woman, but women did not show such a preference. Unlike in the Hadza, SDS preference was not significantly correlated to actual partner SDS.

The current study exploits recent advances in the field of molecular genetics by applying the genomic-relationship-matrix based restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) methods to quantify for the first time the extent to which common genetic variants influence the NEB and the AFB of women. Using data from the UK and the Netherlands (N = 6,758), results show significant additive genetic effects on both traits explaining 10% (SE = 5) of the variance in the NEB and 15% (SE = 4) in the AFB. We further find a significant negative genetic correlation between AFB and NEB in the pooled sample of –0.62 (SE = 0.27, p-value = 0.02). This finding implies that individuals with genetic predispositions for an earlier AFB had a reproductive advantage and that natural selection operated not only in historical, but also in contemporary populations. The observed postponement in the AFB across the past century in Europe contrasts with these findings, suggesting an evolutionary override by environmental effects and underscoring that evolutionary predictions in modern human societies are not straight forward. It emphasizes the necessity for an integrative research design from the fields of genetics and social sciences in order to understand and predict fertility outcomes. Finally, our results suggest that we may be able to find genetic variants associated with human fertility when conducting GWAS-meta analyses with sufficient sample size.”\nauthors = [“Felix C.

Understanding this cross-study heterogeneity of reported preferred family size will contribute to the debates on the uncertainty of fertility in China. This paper quantified how much heterogeneity in aggregate-level fertility preferences can be explained by taking into account the demographic characteristics of the sample, its geographical location, and the measurement of fertility preferences. We retrieved 124 estimates of average preferred family size from 94 publications (from the year 2001 and onwards) in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI) and used mixed-effect meta-regression model to investigate heterogeneity. We found that the average preferred number of children in China since 2001 ranged from 0.91 to 2.88, with an average of 1.70 (SD = 0.26). Demographic differences accounted for 23%, human geographic regionalization for 21%, and the measurement of fertility preferences for 13% of the between-study variation. Sample characteristics (demographic and regional differences) and the measurement of fertility preferences together accounted for 46% of the variation in average preferred fertility.

However, due to constraining factors such as availability of mates, rival competition, and mutual mate choice, preferred characteristics may not be realised in the actual partner. People value height in their partner and we investigated to what extent preferences for height are realised in actual couples. We used data from the Millennium Cohort Study (UK) and compared the distribution of height difference in actual couples to simulations of random mating to test how established mate preferences map on to actual mating patterns. In line with mate preferences, we found evidence for: (i) assortative mating (r = .18), (ii) the male-taller norm, and, for the first time, (iii) for the male-not-too-tall norm. Couples where the male partner was shorter, or over 25 cm taller than the female partner, occurred at lower frequency in actual couples than expected by chance, but the magnitude of these effects was modest. We also investigated another preference rule, namely that short women (and tall men) prefer large height differences with their partner, whereas tall women (and short men) prefer small height differences. These patterns were also observed in our population, although the strengths of these associations were weaker than previously reported strength of preferences. We conclude that while preferences for partner height generally translate into actual pairing, they do so only modestly.”\nauthors = [“Gert Stulp”, “Abraham P. Buunk”, “Thomas V.

ESM data give information on momentary affect, activities and (social) context of, for example, patients suffering from mental disorders, and allows for person-specific feedback reports. However, current personalized feedback reports only display a selection of measured variables, and typically involve only summary statistics, thus not reflecting the dynamic fluctuations in affect and its influencing factors. To address this shortcoming, we developed a tool for dynamically visualizing ESM data. Methods: We introduce a new framework, ESMvis, for giving descriptive feedback, focusing on direct visualization of the dynamic nature of raw data. In this ESM feedback approach, raw ESM data are visualized using R software. We applied ESMvis to data collected for over 52 weeks on a patient diagnosed with an obsessive–compulsive disorder with comorbid depression. Results: We provided personalized feedback, in which both the overall trajectory and specific time moments were captured in a movie format. Two relapses during the study period could be visually determined, and subsequently confirmed by the therapist. The therapist and patient evaluated ESMvis as an insightful add-on tool to care-as-usual. Conclusion: ESMvis is a showcase on providing personalized feedback by dynamic visualization of ESM time-series data. Our tool is freely available and adjustable, making it widely applicable. In addition to potential applications in clinical practice, ESMvis can work as an exploratory tool that can lead to new hypotheses and inform more complex statistical techniques.”\nauthors = [“Laura F Bringmann”, “Date van der Veen”, “Marieke Wichers”, “Harriëtte Riese”, “Gert Stulp”] date = “2020-11-20” image_preview = “” math = true publication_types = [“2”] publication = “Quality of Life Research” publication_short = “” selected = false title = “ESMvis: A tool for visualizing individual Experience Sampling Method (ESM) data” url_code = “” url_dataset = “” url_pdf = “https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-020-02701-4” url_project = “” url_slides = “” url_video = “”\n\nOptional featured image (relative to static/img/ folder).\n[header] image = “” caption = “”\n+++"

Brown (1995) examined heterosexual and homosexual mating preferences for age in men and women. Our study aimed to replicate these findings by examining age preferences in a larger UK online dating sample. Dating advertisements of 996 male and female heterosexuals and homosexuals were coded. Age preferences were assessed via generalized linear models with robust standard errors and bootstrapping. Results showed that the relation between own age and preferred age differed substantially between the groups. With increasing age, heterosexual men preferred younger partners. Older heterosexual men (> 50 years) exclusively sought (much) younger women than themselves, whereas younger heterosexual men sought both older and younger women. Male and female homosexuals followed this general trend of preferring increasingly younger mates with increasing age. However, they displayed a higher upper age tolerance and greater range of acceptable ages than both heterosexual men and women. Female heterosexuals’ age preferences were distinct from the other groups, in that they displayed a male older norm with no substantial interest expressed in males younger than themselves. Our findings thus largely corroborate those of Kenrick et al. with some exceptions, such as a larger tolerance of age ranges in homosexual men and women compared to heterosexual men and women.

We consider that there are strong arguments in favor of measuring fertility (and proxies thereof) in industrial populations, not least because of the wide availability of large-scale secondary databases. Such data sources bring challenges as well as advantages, however. The purpose of this article is to illustrate these by examining the association between wealth and reproductive success in the United States, using the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979. We conduct a broad-based exploratory analysis of the relationship between wealth and fertility, employing both cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches, and multiple measures of both wealth (income and net worth) and fertility (lifetime reproductive success and transitions to first, second and third births). We highlight the kinds of decisions that have to be made regarding sample selection, along with the selection and construction of explanatory variables and control measures. Based on our analyses, we find a positive effect of both income and net worth on fertility for men, which is more pronounced for white men and for transitions to first and second births. Income tends to have a negative effect on fertility for women, while net worth is more likely to positively predict fertility. Different reproductive strategies among different groups within the same population highlight the complexity of the reproductive ecology of industrial societies. These results differ in a number of respects from other analyses using the same database. We suggest this reflects the impossibility of producing a definitive analysis, rather than a failure to identify the ‘correct’ analytical strategy.

We suggest that the nature of the relationship between wealth and fertility remains an open question because of the multi-faceted nature of wealth, and because existing cross-sectional studies are ambiguous with respect to how material wealth and fertility are linked. A literature review of longitudinal studies on wealth and fertility shows that the majority of these report positive effects of wealth, although levels of fertility seem to fall below those that would maximize fitness. We emphasize that reproductive decision-making reflects a complex interplay between individual and societal factors that resists simple evolutionary interpretation, and highlight the role of economic insecurity in fertility decisions.

Although the positive correlation between the stature of spouses has often been noted in western populations, recent papers suggest that mating patterns for stature are not universal. The objective of this paper was to review the published evidence to examine the strength of and universality in assortative mating for height. Methods: We conducted an extensive literature review and meta‐analysis. We started with published reviews but also searched through secondary databases. Our search led to 154 correlations of height between partners. We classified the populations as western and non‐western based on geography. These correlations were then analyzed via meta‐analytic techniques. Results: 148 of the correlations for partner heights were positive and the overall analysis indicates moderate positive assortative mating (r = .23). Although assortative mating was slightly stronger in countries that can be described as western compared to non‐western, this difference was not statistically significant. We found no evidence for a change in assortative mating for height over time. There was substantial residual heterogeneity in effect sizes and this heterogeneity was most pronounced in western countries. Conclusions: Positive assortative mating for height exists in human populations, but is modest in magnitude suggesting that height is not a major factor in mate choice. Future research is necessary to understand the underlying causes of the large amount of heterogeneity observed in the degree of assortative mating across human populations, which may stem from a combination of methodological and ecological differences.”\nauthors = [“Gert Stulp”, “Mirre JP Simons”, “Sara Grasman”, “Thomas V Pollet”] date = “2016-09-17” image_preview = “” math = true publication_types = [“2”] publication = “In American Journal of Human Biology” publication_short = “AHJB” selected = false title = “Assortative mating for human height: A meta‐analysis” url_code = “” url_dataset = “” url_pdf = “https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.22917” url_project = “” url_slides = “” url_video = “”\n[[url_custom]] name = “View Journal Article” url = “https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.22917”\n\nOptional featured image (relative to static/img/ folder).\n[header] image = “” caption = “”\n+++"

In this study, we tested these ideas using large personal networks (25 associates of the respondent) collected from a sample of Dutch women (N = 706). Kin (parents) were perceived to exert slightly more social pressure to have children than non-kin, although dense networks were not associated with greater pressure. In contrast, women reported talking to friends about having children to a greater extent than kin, although greater kin-density in the network increased the likelihood of women reporting that they could talk to kin about having children. Both consanguineal and affinal kin could be asked to help with child-care to a greater extent than friends and other non-kin.

In this study, we explore an innovative sociogenomic approach, which entails including key socio-demographic (marriage, education, occupation, religion, cohort) and genetic factors related to both behavioral [age at first birth (AFB), number of children ever born (NEB)] and biological fecundity-related outcomes (endometriosis, age at menopause and menarche, polycystic ovary syndrome, azoospermia, testicular dysgenesis syndrome) to explain childlessness. We examine the association of all sets of factors with childlessness as well as the interplay between them. We derive polygenic scores (PGS) from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and apply these in the Health and Retirement Study (N = 10,686) and Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (N = 8,284). Both socio-demographic and genetic factors were associated with childlessness. Whilst socio-demographic factors explain 19–46% in childlessness, the current PGS explains &lt;1% of the variance, and only PGSs from large GWASs are related to childlessness. Our findings also indicate that genetic and socio-demographic factors are not independent, with PGSs for AFB and NEB related to education and age at marriage. The explained variance by polygenic scores on childlessness is limited since it is largely a behavioral trait, with genetic explanations expected to increase somewhat in the future with better-powered GWASs. As genotyping of individuals in social science surveys becomes more prevalent, the method described in this study can be applied to other outcomes.”\nauthors = [“Renkse M Verweij”, “Melinda C Mills”, “Gert Stulp”, “Ilja M Nolte”, “Nicola Barban”, “Felix C Tropf”] date = “2019-11-12” image_preview = “” math = true publication_types = [“2”] publication = “Frontiers in Sociology” publication_short = “” selected = false title = “Using Polygenic Scores in Social Science Research: Unraveling Childlessness” url_code = “” url_dataset = “” url_pdf = “https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsoc.2019.00074/full” url_project = “” url_slides = “” url_video = “”\n\nOptional featured image (relative to static/img/ folder).\n[header] image = “” caption = “”\n+++\nFull citation, including all authors: Verweij, R.

We hypothesized that wider-faced males, being more aggressive and robust, would be less likely than narrower-faced males to die from contact violence (stabbed, strangled, or bludgeoned to death) compared with other forms of homicide. We tested this hypothesis in a forensic data sample covering 523 male and 339 female skeletons. In these data, men with narrower faces were more likely to have died as a consequence of homicides involving direct physical contact than men with wider faces. No such effect was found for women. This effect was found when considering all causes of mortality and when limiting the sample to homicides. This finding suggests that wider-faced males are less likely to die from male–male physical violence, perhaps because of their formidability.

From being one of the shortest European populations in the 19th Century, the Dutch grew some 20 cm and are currently the tallest population in the world. Wealth, hygiene, and diet are well-established contributors to this major increase in height. Some have suggested that natural selection may also contribute to the trend, but evidence is weak. Here, we investigate the potential role of natural selection in the increase in height through simulations. We first ask what if natural selection was solely responsible for the observed increase in height? If the increase in average height was fully due to natural selection on male height, then across six consecutive generations, men who were two standard deviation above average height would need to have eight times more children on average. If selection acted only through those who have the opportunity to reproduce, then reproduction would need to be restricted to the tallest third (37%) of the population in order to give rise to the stark increase in height over time. No linear relationship between height and child mortality is able to account for the increase over time. We then present simulations based on previously observed estimates of partnership, mortality, selection and heritability and show that natural selection had a negligible effect (estimates from 0.07 to 0.36 cm) on the increase in height in the period 1850 to 2000. Our simulations highlight the plasticity of height and how remarkable the trend in height is in evolutionary terms. Only by using a combination of methods and insights from different disciplines, including biology, demography, and history are we potentially able to address how much of the increase in height is due to natural selection versus other causes.”\nauthors = [“Gert Stulp”, “Tyler Bonnel”, “Louise Barrett”] date = “2023-03-23” image_preview = “” math = true publication_types = [“2”] publication = “The History of the Family” publication_short = “” selected = false title = “Simulating the evolution of height in the Netherlands in recent history” url_code = “” url_dataset = “” url_pdf = “https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1081602X.2023.2192193” url_project = “” url_slides = “” url_video = “”\n\nOptional featured image (relative to static/img/ folder).\n[header] image = “” caption = “”\n+++"

One potential explanation is that taller individuals are more likely to win a dyadic confrontation with a competitor (i.e., they are more dominant), which leads to higher social rank. Although some previous studies have shown that perceptions of status or dominance are related to height, and are therefore consistent with such an explanation, there is surprisingly little research testing whether height actually has any influence on the behavioural outcomes in real-life social interactions. Here, we present three naturalistic observational studies demonstrating that height predicts interpersonal dominance during brief dyadic interactions. Study 1 investigated the likelihood of giving way in a narrow passage (N = 92); Study 2 investigated giving way in a busy shopping street, plus the likelihood of colliding with another individual (N = 1,108); and Study 3 investigated the likelihood of maintaining a linear path while walking, and potentially entering another individual’s personal space (N = 1,056).

This plasticity also has limits, and identifying those limits can help researchers: (1) parse when population differences arise from environmental inputs or not and (2) determine when it is possible to infer socioeconomic disparities from disparities in body form. To illustrate potential limits to environmental plasticity, we analyze body mass index (BMI) and height data from 1,768,962 women and 207,341 men (20–49 y) living in households exhibiting 1000-fold variation in household wealth (51 countries, 1985–2017, 164 surveys) across four world regions—sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Latin America, and North Africa and the Middle East. We find that relationships of environmental inputs with both mean height and BMI bottom out at roughly 100–700 USD per capita household wealth (2011 international units, PPP), but at different basal BMIs and basal heights for different regions. The relationship with resources tops out for BMI at around 20K–35K USD for women, with growth potential due to environmental inputs in the range of 6.2–8.4kg/m2. By contrast, mean BMI for men and mean height for both sexes remains sensitive to environmental inputs even at levels far above the low- and middle-income samples studied here. This suggest that further work integrating comparable data from low- and high-income samples should provide a better picture of the full range of environmental inputs on human height and BMI.

In order to avoid pseudoreplication, it is commonplace to aggregate data, generating a mean score per individual, and then using these aggregated data in subsequent analyses. Aggregation, however, can generate problems of its own. Not only does it lead to a loss of information, it can also leave analyses vulnerable to the “ecological fallacy”: the drawing of false inferences about individual behavior on the basis of population level (“ecological”) data. It can also result in Simpson’s paradox, where relationships seen at the individual level can be completely reversed when analyzed at the aggregate level. These phenomena have been documented widely in the medical and social sciences but tend to go unremarked in primatological studies that rely on observational data from the field. Here, we provide a conceptual guide that explains how and why aggregate data are vulnerable to the ecological fallacy and Simpson’s paradox, illustrating these points using data on baboons. We then discuss one particular analytical approach, namely multi‐level modeling, that can potentially eliminate these problems. By highlighting the issue of the ecological fallacy, and increasing awareness of how datasets are often organized into a number of different levels, we also highlight the manner in which researchers can more positively exploit the structure of their datasets, without any information loss.

However, little is known about such partner preferences in homosexual individuals. Based on an online survey of a large sample of non-heterosexual men (N = 541), we found that the majority of men prefer a partner slightly taller than themselves. However, these preferences were dependent on the participant’s own height, such that taller men preferred shorter partners, whereas shorter men preferred taller partners. We also examined whether height preferences predicted the preference for dominance and the adoption of particular sexual roles within a couple. Although a large proportion of men preferred to be in an egalitarian relationship with respect to preferred dominance (although not with respect to preferred sexual role), men that preferred a more dominant and more “active” sexual role preferred shorter partners, whereas those that preferred a more submissive and more “passive” sexual role preferred taller partners.

On the one hand, we have evolved like all other species, forming a branch of the tree of life along with the rest of the animal kingdom. A complete understanding of humans and their place in the world thus requires we take an evolutionary perspective. On the other hand, the remarkable cultural diversity observed among human populations, combined with our apparent agency—our ability to decide whether or not to act on the decisions we make—complicates matters enormously, and seems to place us outside of nature. How, for example, can we explain the decision to actively avoid having children as a trait that evolved by the action of natural selection? In addition, there are some questions that do not seem to require an evolutionary explanation such as: how do you humans make meaning in their lives? Or is socialized health care a good idea? Or what are the moral and legal implications of new reproductive technologies? In other words, while an evolutionary perspective is necessary for a complete explanation of human behaviour, such a perspective is not always essential. Indeed, many areas of the social sciences do very well without a specific evolutionary orientation. It is also notable that some social scientists actively resist the application of evolutionary approaches within their discipline. Some of this resistance reflects a dissatisfaction with the nature and quality of the evolutionary approaches on offer, particularly those emanating from within psychology. Sometimes, however, resistance seems to be built on faulty ideologically-driven assumptions about what an evolutionary-oriented approach entails. The most productive way forward is to adopt a pluralist biosocial perspective to the study of human behaviour; one that draws on a number of disciplines within the natural and social sciences, without any attempt to reduce one to the other, or deny the existence and importance of any particular discipline."

Information on the personal networks of individuals is therefore of great interest to many researchers. Unfortunately, such data are rarely collected because of the respondent burden of naming many individuals in their network and repeatedly answering questions about these individuals. Using GENSI—a recently developed (freely available) graphical tool to collect personal networks—we collected large personal network data from a representative sample of Dutch women between 18 and 40 (N = 758) through the LISS-panel; a longitudinal internet survey of Dutch individuals. Respondents had to list exactly 25 names of individuals with whom they had communicated within the last year, and answered several questions about these individuals, including demographic characteristics and fertility outcomes. In this talk, we show the workings of GENSI; report on the experiences respondents had with the survey; and reflect on the quality of the responses. Our results show that collecting large personal networks is feasible through this method without burdening the respondents too much, generating unique data. The value of data on large personal networks in representative samples will be discussed for sociological questions.” abstract_short = “” event = “Dag van de Demografie” event_url = “http://www.nvdemografie.nl/activiteiten/nederlandse-demografiedag” location = “Utrecht, the Netherlands”\nselected = true math = true\nurl_pdf = “” url_slides = “” url_video = “”\n\nOptional featured image (relative to static/img/ folder).\n[header] image = “” caption = “”\n+++"

Many different and contradicting mechanisms have been proposed to explain why highly educated women are more likely to remain childless and become mothers at higher ages than less educated women. The demands on data to disentangle these mechanisms are extraordinary, and no dataset exists that allows for this. Microsimulation models can help in this situation by explicitly modelling the mechanisms and comparing the outcomes of the models to real-world outcomes. The simulation models presented here simulate fertility outcomes over the life courses of agents based on behavioural factors, such preferences and partnership trajectories, and biological factors that determine the ability to have children, such as the age at sterility, fecundability, and intrauterine mortality. To parametrise the models, we use administrative data from Social Statistics Netherlands, survey data from the LISS panel for the behavioural factors, and findings from reproductive medicine for the biological parameters. Our models show that unintended childlessness strongly differs between women with different educational levels. Despite higher educated women preferring to have children at a later age, our simulations showed that these preferences hardly played a role in explaining childlessness. The higher age at cohabitation was the main explanation for the higher unintended childlessness among highly educated women.

One hypothesis is that kin may impart more pro-natal information within their networks than non-kin, and that this effect may be exacerbated in networks with high kin-density where greater social conformity would be expected. In this study, we tested these ideas using large personal networks (25 associates of the respondent) collected from a sample of Dutch women (N = 706). Kin (parents) were perceived to exert slightly more social pressure to have children than non-kin, although dense networks were not associated with greater pressure. In contrast, women reported talking to friends about having children to a greater extent than kin, although greater kin-density in the network increased the likelihood of women reporting that they could talk to kin about having children. Both consanguineal and affinal kin could be asked to help with child-care to a greater extent than friends and other non-kin.

From being one of the shortest European populations in the 18th Century, the Dutch grew some 20 centimetres and are currently the tallest population in the world. Wealth, hygiene, and diet have all contributed to this increase in height. In addition, there is some research to suggest that natural selection also favours taller heights among the Dutch. Caution is warranted here, though, as this work is based only on phenotypic associations between people’s height and number of offspring in a contemporary population. As such, it can say little about the increase in height over the past centuries. It is also apparent that the response to selection of observed selection gradients could only minimally account for the increase in height. The calculation of such a response, however, involves making a range of assumptions on height across history that are and perhaps can never be verified. Simulation studies can help us here as they allow us to vary our assumptions and so verify their consequences. The aim of this research is to simulate the evolution of height in the Netherlands across the last two hundred years. Effects of the environment and the heritability of height will vary across time based on estimates from other studies. The strength of selection can be varied across men and women, as well as mating patterns that change the response to selection (e.g., assortative mating). By parametrising the model by observed heights across history, and by varying the strength of selection, we aim to get insight on plausible estimates of how much natural selection has contributed to the major increase in stature in the Netherlands.

Using GENSI—a recently developed (freely available) graphical tool to collect personal networks—we collected large personal network data from a representative sample of Dutch women between 18 and 40 (N = 758) through the LISS-panel; a longitudinal internet survey of Dutch individuals. Respondents had to list exactly 25 names of individuals with whom they had communicated within the last year, and answered several questions about these individuals, including demographic characteristics and fertility outcomes. In this talk, we show the workings of GENSI; report on the experiences respondents had with the survey; and reflect on the quality of the responses.

Some forms of human behaviour in the industrialised world might be similarly “mismatched”, and this idea is gaining in popularity in the medical and psychological sciences. In this talk, we try to argue the following points: 1) although the idea of “mismatch” provides a valuable perspective, it is often rather uncritically used; 2) the predictive ability of this perspective is often limited; even in rather clear cases such as obesity; 3) supposed cases of mismatch are often not backed up by appropriate empirical data; 4) this perspective is more valuable for the peculiarities of our body than of our mind. We conclude that the “mismatch” perspective is valuable in understanding (some) contemporary human behaviour, but that its use should be more stringent.

One hypothesis is that kin may impart more pro-natal information within their networks than non-kin, and that this effect may be exacerbated in networks with high kin-density where greater social conformity would be expected. In this study, we tested these ideas using large personal networks (25 associates of the respondent) collected from a sample of Dutch women (N = 706). Kin (parents) were perceived to exert slightly more social pressure to have children than non-kin, although dense networks were not associated with greater pressure. In contrast, women reported talking to friends about having children to a greater extent than kin, although greater kin-density in the network increased the likelihood of women reporting that they could talk to kin about having children. Both consanguineal and affinal kin could be asked to help with child-care to a greater extent than friends and other non-kin.

Multiple social influence mechanisms are thought to change people’s fertility behaviour, including social learning, social contagion, social capital, and social pressure. Comprehensively investigating these mechanisms of social influence in contemporary populations has been difficult, and most findings stem from convenience samples, qualitative studies, or studies focussing on single mechanisms. Here we examine the opportunity for social influence by these different mechanisms simultaneously using a unique representative sample of 706 Dutch women reporting on 17,650 social relations (obtained via the LISS panel). In particular, we investigated variation in the composition of the network in terms of fertility-relevant characteristics, including the number of childfree individuals in the personal network, the number of people with (young) children, and the number of people that can help you with child care. Characterising variation in these traits in personal networks gives unique insights into the opportunities for social influence.

Many different and contradicting mechanisms have been proposed to explain why highly educated women are more likely to remain childless and become mothers at higher ages than less educated women. The demands on data to disentangle these mechanisms are extraordinary, and no dataset exists that allows for this. Microsimulation models can help in this situation by explicitly modelling the mechanisms and comparing the outcomes of the models to real-world outcomes. The simulation models presented here simulate fertility outcomes over the life courses of agents based on behavioural factors, such preferences and partnership trajectories, and biological factors that determine the ability to have children, such as the age at sterility, fecundability, and intrauterine mortality. To parametrise the models, we use administrative data from Social Statistics Netherlands, survey data from the LISS panel for the behavioural factors, and findings from reproductive medicine for the biological parameters. To estimate unknown parameters in the models (for which no data are available), we use Approximate Bayesian Computation. This is computationally rather demanding which is why we have used supercomputers. Our simulations reproduce the pattern of unintended childlessness strongly varying across women with different educational levels. Despite higher educated women preferring to have children at a later age, our simulations showed that these preferences hardly played a role in explaining childlessness. The higher age at cohabitation was the main explanation for the higher unintended childlessness among highly educated women. We discuss how these models can be used to explain the surprising reversal in gradient between education and fertility that is observed in Scandinavian countries.

Such research has uncovered many characteristics underlying fertility. Unfortunately, traditional ways of statistical analyses means that results are difficult to compare across studies and that we have little understanding on the (relative) importance of these characteristics. In light of the credibility crisis that has taken hold of many other fields and disciplines, one might similarly worry about the robustness of findings in demography. In this talk I will argue that a focus on predictive ability and on microsimulation will advance fertility research and make it more reliable. In the first part of the talk, I will make a plea for reporting out-of-sample predictive ability. I argue that this form of predictive ability i) is the most relevant effect size we should be interested in, because it is a measure of how well our theories do in practice, ii) prevents overfitting and is less susceptible to researcher degrees of freedom, iii) facilitates comparison between theory and data-driven approaches, and iv) allows for prediction benchmarks which have facilitated cumulative knowledge in other disciplines. In the second part of the talk, I will discuss how microsimulation models of fertility can advance existing research. A simulation model that includes findings from reproductive medicine on the ability to have children (e.g., the age at sterility, fecundability) is developed to quantify to what extent higher levels of childlessness among highly educated Dutch women are explained by preferences and partnership trajectories. I conclude by arguing that a shift towards prediction in combination with theory-driven microsimulation models increases the robustness of findings and allows a unique perspective on the state of fertility research.” abstract_short = “” event = “Brown Bag Meeting” event_url = “” location = “NIDI, The Hague, the Netherlands” selected = true math = true\nurl_pdf = “” url_slides = “pdf/2022_NIDI_May 24_Gert Stulp.pdf” url_video = “”\n\nOptional featured image (relative to static/img/ folder).\n[header] image = “” caption = “”\n+++"

    "text": "Reproducibility, or “the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as the original investigator”, is critical for sharing and building upon scientific findings. Reproducibility not only verifies the correctness of processes leading to results but also serves as a prerequisite for assessing generalisability to other datasets or contexts. This we refer to as replicability, or “the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but new data are collected”. Reproducibility, which is the focus of our work here, can be challenging – especially in the context of deep learning. This article, and associated material, aims to provide practical advice for overcoming these challenges.\nOur story begins with Davit Svanidze, a master’s degree student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). Davit’s efforts to make his bachelor’s thesis reproducible are what inspires this article, and we hope that readers will be able to learn from Davit’s experience and apply those learnings to their own work. Davit will demonstrate the use of Jupyter notebooks, GitHub, and other relevant tools to ensure reproducibility. He will walk us through code documentation, data management, and version control with Git. And, he will share best practices for collaboration, peer review, and dissemination of results.\nDavit’s story starts here, but there is much more for the interested reader to discover. At certain points in this article, we will direct readers to other resources, namely a Jupyter notebook and GitHub repository which contain all the instructions, data and code necessary to reproduce Davit’s research. Together, these components offer a comprehensive overview of the thought process and technical implementation required for reproducibility. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, the principles remain consistent."

    "text": "Davit’s journey towards reproducibility\n\nMore power, please\nThe focus of my bachelor’s thesis was to better understand the initial spread of Covid-19 in China using deep learning algorithms. I was keen to make my work reproducible, but not only for my own sake. The “reproducibility crisis” is a well-documented problem in science as a whole,1 2 3 4 with studies suggesting that around one-third of social science studies published between the years 2010 and 2015 in top journals like Nature and Science could not be reproduced.5 Results that cannot be reproduced are not necessarily “wrong”. But, if findings cannot be reproduced, we cannot be sure of their validity.\nFor my own research project, I gathered all data and started working on my computer. After I built the algorithms to train the data, my first challenge to reproducibility was computational. I realised that training models on my local computer was taking far too long, and I needed a faster, more powerful solution to be able to submit my thesis in time. Fortunately, I could access the university server to train the algorithms. Once the training was complete, I could generate the results on my local computer, since producing maps and tables was not so demanding. However…\n\n\nBloody paths!\nIn switching between machines and computing environments, I soon encountered an issue with my code: the paths, or file directory locations, for the trained algorithms had been hardcoded! As I quickly discovered, hardcoding a path can lead to issues when the code is run in a different environment, as the path might not exist in the new environment.\nAs my code became longer, I overlooked the path names linked to algorithms that were generating the results. This mistake – which would have been easily corrected if spotted earlier – resulted in incorrect outputs. Such errors could have enormous (negative) implications in a public health context, where evidence-based decisions have real impacts on human lives. It was at this point that I realised that my code is the fundamental pillar of the validity of my empirical work. How can someone trust my work if they are not able to verify it?\nThe following dummy code demonstrates the hardcoding issue:\n```{python}\n# Hardcoded path\nfile_path = \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\"\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nIn the code above, a dummy file (toydata.csv) is used. The dummy file contains data on the prices of three different toys, but only the path of the file is relevant to this example. If the hardcoded file path – \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\" – exists on the machine being used, the code will run just fine. But, when run in a different environment without said path, the code will result in a \"File not found error\". Better code that uses relative paths can be written as:\n```{python}\n# Relative path\nimport os\n\nfile_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"toydata.csv\")\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nYou can see that this code has successfully imported data from the dataset toydata.csv and printed its two columns (toy and price) and three rows.\nThe following example is a simplified version of what happened when I wrote code to train several models, store the results and run a procedure to compare results with the predictive performance of a benchmark model:\n```{python}\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\"}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\"}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model1.csv', index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Load the model result and compare with benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model\nresult = pd.read_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model2.csv').iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nEverything looks fine at a glance. But, if you examine the code carefully, you may spot the problem. Initially, when I coded the procedure (training the model, saving and loading the results), I hardcoded the paths and had to change them for each tested model. First, I trained model2, a complex model, and tested it against the benchmark (70 > 50 → accepted). I repeated the procedure for model1 (a simple model). Its result was identical to model2, therefore I kept model1 following the parsimony principle.\nHowever, for the code line loading the result for the current model (line 5, second cell), I forgot to amend the path and so mistakenly loaded the result of model2. As a consequence, I accepted a model which should have been rejected. These wrong results were then spread further in the code, including all charts and maps and the conclusions of my analysis.\nA small coding error like this can therefore be fatal to an analysis. Below is the corrected code:\n```{python}\nimport os\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details (INCLUDING PATHS) in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model1.csv\")}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model2.csv\")}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv(current_model[\"path\"], index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Get the model result and compare with the benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model WITH a VARIABLE PATH\nresult = pd.read_csv(current_model[\"path\"]).iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nHere, the paths are stored with other model details (line 7–8, first cell). Therefore, we can use them as variables when we need them (e.g., line 16, first cell, and line 5, second cell). Now, when the current model is set to model1 (line 11, first cell), everything is automatically adjusted. Also, if the path details need to be changed, we only need to change them once and everything else is automatically adjusted and updated. The code now correctly states that model1 performs worse than the benchmark and is therefore rejected and we should keep model2, which performs best.\nI managed to catch this error in time, but it often can be difficult to spot our own mistakes. That is why making code available to others is crucial. A code review by a second (or third) pair of eyes can save everyone a lot of time and avoid spreading incorrect results and conclusions.\n\n\nSolving compatibility chaos with Docker\nOne might think that it would be easy to copy code from one computer to another and run it without difficulties, but it turns out to be a real headache. Different operating systems on my local computer and the university server caused multiple compatibility issues and it was very time-consuming to try to solve them. The university server was running on Ubuntu, a Linux distribution, which was not compatible with my macOS-based code editor. Moreover, the server did not support the Python programming language – and all the deep learning algorithm packages that I needed – in the same way as my macOS computer did.\nAs a remedy, I used Docker containers, which allowed me to create a virtual environment with all the necessary packages and dependencies installed. This way, I could integrate them with different hardware and use the processing power of that hardware. To get started with Docker, I first had to install it on my local computer. The installation process is straightforward and the Docker website provides step-by-step instructions for different operating systems. In fact, I found the Docker website very helpful, with lots of resources and tutorials available. Once Docker was installed, it was easy to create virtual environments for my project and work with my code, libraries, and packages, without any compatibility issues. Not only did Docker containers save me a lot of time and effort, but they could also make it easier for others to reproduce my work.\nBelow is an example of a Dockerfile which recreates an environment with Python 3.7 on Linux. It describes what, how, when and in which order operations should be carried out to generate the environment with all Python packages required to run the main Python script, main.py.\n\n\nAn example of a Dockerfile.\n\nIn this example, by downloading the project, including the Dockerfile, anyone can run main.py without installing packages or worrying about what OS was used for development or which Python version should be installed. You can view Docker as a great robot chef: show it a recipe (Dockerfile), provide the ingredients (project files), push the start button (to build the container) and wait to sample the results.\n\n\nWhy does nobody check your code?\nEven after implementing Docker, I still faced another challenge to reproducibility: making the verification process for my code easy enough that it could be done by anyone, without them needing a degree in computer science! Increasingly, there is an expectation for researchers to share their code so that results can be reproduced, but there are as yet no widely accepted or enforced standards on how to make code readable and reusable. However, if we are to embrace the concept of reproducibility, we must write and publish code under the assumption that someone, somewhere – boss, team member, journal reviewer, reader – will want to rerun our code. And, if we expect that someone will want to rerun our code (and hopefully check it), we should ensure that the code is readable and does not take too long to run.\nIf your code does take too long to run, some operations can often be accelerated – for example, by reducing the size of the datasets or by implementing computationally efficient data processing approaches (e.g., using PyTorch). Aim for a running time of a few minutes – or about as long as it takes to make a cup of tea or coffee. Of course, if data needs to be reduced to save computational time, the person rerunning your code won’t generate the same results as in your original analysis. This therefore will not lead to reproducibility, sensu stricto. However, as long as you state clearly what are the expected results from the reduced dataset, your peers can at least inspect your code and offer feedback, and this marks a step towards reproducibility.\nWe should also make sure our code is free from bugs – both the kind that might lead to errors in analysis and also those that stop the code running to completion. Bugs can occur for various reasons. For example, some code chunks written on a Windows machine may not properly execute on a macOS machine because the former uses \\ for file paths, while the latter uses /:\n```{python}\n# Path works on macOS/Linux\nwith open(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n\n# Path works only on Windows    \nwith open(r\"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n   print(f.read())\n```\n\nHere, only the macOS/Linux version works, since the code this capture was taken from was implemented on a Linux server. There are alternatives, however. The code below works on macOS, Linux, and also Windows machines:\n```{python}\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Path works on every OS: macOS/Linux/Windows\n# It will automatically replace the path to \"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\" when it runs on Windows\nwith open(Path(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\"), \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n```\n\nThe extra Python package, pathlib, is of course unnecessary if you build a Docker container for your project, as discussed in the previous section.\n\n\nJupyter, King of the Notebooks\nBy this stage in my project, I was feeling that I’d made good progress towards ensuring that my work would be reproducible. I’d expended a lot of effort to make my code readable, efficient, and also absent of bugs (or, at least, this is what I was hoping for). I’d also built a Docker container to allow others to replicate my computing environment and rerun the analysis. Still, I wanted to make sure there were no barriers that would prevent people – my supervisors, in particular – from being able to review the work I had done for my undergraduate thesis. What I wanted was a way to present a complete narrative of my project that was easy to understand and follow. For this, I turned to Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nJupyter notebooks combine Markdown text, code, and visualisations. The notebook itself can sit within an online directory of folders and files that contain all the data and code related to a project, allowing readers to understand the processes behind the work and also access the raw resources. From the notebook I produced, readers can see exactly what I did, how I did it, and what my results were.\nWhile creating my notebook, I was able to experiment with my code and iterate quickly. Code cells within a document can be run interactively, which allowed me to try out different approaches to solving a problem and see the results almost in real time. I could also get feedback from others and try out new ideas without having to spend a lot of time writing and debugging code.\n\n\nVersion control with Git and GitHub\nMy Jupyter notebook and associated folders and files are all available via GitHub. Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a central repository for storing and sharing code. With Git and GitHub, I was able to version my code and collaborate with others without the risk of losing any work. I really couldn’t afford to redo the entire year I spent on my dissertation!\nGit and GitHub are great for reproducibility. By sharing code via these platforms, others can access your work, verify it and reproduce your results without risking changing or, worse, destroying your work – whether partially or completely. These tools also make it easy for others to build on your work if they want to further develop your research. You can also use Git and GitHub to share or promote your results across a wider community. The ability to easily store and share your code also makes it easy to keep track of the different versions of your code and to see how your work has evolved.\nThe following illustration shows the tracking of very simple changes in a Python file. The previous version of the code is shown on the left; the new version is shown on the right. Additions and deletions are highlighted in green and red, and with + and - symbols, respectively.\n\n\nA simple example of GitHub version tracking."

    "text": "The deep learning challenge\nSo far, this article has dealt with barriers to reproducibility – and ways around them – that will apply to most, if not all, modern research projects. While I’d encourage any scientist to adopt these practices in their own work, it is important to stress that these alone cannot guarantee reproducibility. In cases where standard statistical procedures are used within statistical software packages, reproducibility is often achievable. However, in reality, even when following the same procedures, differences in outputs can occur, and identifying the reasons for this may be challenging. Cooking offers a simple analogy: subtle changes in room temperature or ingredient quality from one day to the next can impact the final product.\nOne of the challenges for research projects employing machine learning and deep learning algorithms is that outputs can be influenced by the randomness that is inherent in these approaches. Consider the four portraits below, generated by the Midjourney bot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nEach portrait looks broadly similar at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, critical differences emerge. These differences arise because deep learning models rely on numerous interconnected layers to learn intricate patterns and representations. Slight random perturbations, such as initial parameter values or changes in data samples, can propagate through the network, leading to different decisions during the learning process. As a result, even seemingly negligible randomness can amplify and manifest as considerable differences in the final output, as with the distinct features of the portraits.\nRandomness is not necessarily a bad thing – it mitigates overfitting and helps predictions to be generalised. However, it does present an additional barrier to reproducibility. If you cannot get the same results using the same raw materials – data, code, packages and computing environment – then you might have good reasons to doubt the validity of the findings.\nThere are many elements of an analysis in which randomness may be present and lead to different results. For example, in a classification (where your dependent variable is binary, e.g., success/failure with 1 and 0) or a regression (where your dependent variable is continuous, e.g., temperature measurements of 10.1°C, 2.8°C, etc.), you might need to split your data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to estimate the model (hyper)parameters and the testing set is used to compute the performance of the model. The way the split is usually operationalised is as a random selection of rows of your data. So, in principle, each time you split your data into training and testing sets, you may end up with different rows in each set. Differences in the training set may therefore lead to different values of the model (hyper)parameters and affect the predictive performance that is measured from the testing set. Also, differences in the testing set may lead to variations in the predictive performance scores, which in turn lead to potentially different interpretations and, ultimately, decisions if the results are used for that purpose.\nThis aspect of randomness in the training of models is relatively well known. But randomness may hide in other parts of code. One such example is illustrated below. Here, using Python, we set the seed number to 0 using np.random.seed(seed value). The random.seed() function from the package numpy (abbreviated np) saves the state of a random function so that it can create identical random numbers independently of the machine you use, and this is for any number of executions. A seed value is an initial input or starting point used by a pseudorandom number generator to generate a sequence of random numbers. It is often an integer or a timestamp. The number generator takes this seed value and uses it to produce a deterministic series of random numbers that appear to be random but can be recreated by using the same seed value. Without providing this seed value, the first execution of the function typically uses the current system time. The animation below generates two random arrays arr1 and arr2 using np.random.rand(3,2). Note that the values 3,2 indicate that we want random values for an array that has 3 rows and 2 columns.\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\n\n#Set the seed number e.g. to 0\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Set the seed number as before to get the same results\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nIf you run the code yourself multiple times, the values of arr1 and arr2 should remain identical. If this is not the case, check that the seed value is set to 0 in lines 4 and 11. These identical results are possible because we set the seed value to 0, which ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers each time the code is run. Now, let’s look at what happens if we remove the line np.random.seed(0):\n```{python}\n#Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nHere, the values of arr1 and arr2 will be different each time we run the code since the seed value was not set and is therefore changing over time.\nThis short code demonstrates how randomness that can be controlled by the seed value may affect your code. Therefore, unless randomness is required, e.g., to get some uncertainty in the results, setting the seed value will contribute to making your work reproducible. I also find it helpful to document the seed number I use in my code so that I can easily reproduce my findings in the future. If you are currently working on some code that involves random number generators, it might be worth checking your code and making all necessary changes. In our work (see code chunk 9 in the Jupyter notebook) we set the seed value in a general way, using a framework (config) so that our code always uses the same seed to train our algorithm."

    "text": "Conclusion\nWe hope you have enjoyed learning more about our quest for reproducibility. We have explained why reproducibility matters and provided tips for how to achieve it – or, at least, work towards it. We have introduced a few important issues that you are likely to encounter on your own path to reproducibility. In sum, we have mentioned:\n\nThe importance of having relative instead of hard-coded paths in code.\nOperating system compatibility issues, which can be solved by using Docker containers for a consistent computing environment.\nThe convenience of Jupyter notebooks for code editing – particularly useful for data science projects and work using deep learning because of the ability to include text and code in the same document and make the work accessible to everyone (so long as they have an internet connection).\nThe need for version control using, for example, Git and GitHub, which allows you to keep track of changes in your code and collaborate with others efficiently.\nThe importance of setting the seed values in random number generators.\n\nThe graphic below provides a visual overview of the different components of our study and shows how each component works with the others to support reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use (A) the version control system, Git, and its hosting service, GitHub, which enables a team to share code with peers, efficiently track and synchronise code changes between local and server machines, and reset the project to a working state in case something breaks. Docker containers (B) include all necessary objects (engine, data, and scripts). Docker needs to be installed (plain-line arrows) by all users (project leader, collaborator(s), reviewer(s), and public user(s)) on their local machines (C); and (D) we use a user-friendly interface (JupyterLab) deployed from a local machine to facilitate the operations required to reproduce the work. The project leader and collaborators can edit (upload/download) the project files stored on the GitHub server (plain-line arrows) while reviewers and public users can only read the files (dotted-line arrows).\nNow, it is over to you. Our Jupyter notebook provides a walkthrough of our research. Our GitHub repository has all the data, code and other files you need to reproduce our work, and this README file will help you get started.\nAnd with that, we wish you all the best on the road to reproducibility!\n\nFind more case studies\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the authors\n\nDavit Svanidze is a master’s degree student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE).

    "text": "Reproducibility, or “the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as the original investigator”, is critical for sharing and building upon scientific findings. Reproducibility not only verifies the correctness of processes leading to results but also serves as a prerequisite for assessing generalisability to other datasets or contexts. This we refer to as replicability, or “the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but new data are collected”. Reproducibility, which is the focus of our work here, can be challenging – especially in the context of deep learning. This article, and associated material, aims to provide practical advice for overcoming these challenges.\nOur story begins with Davit Svanidze, a master’s degree student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). Davit’s efforts to make his bachelor’s thesis reproducible are what inspires this article, and we hope that readers will be able to learn from Davit’s experience and apply those learnings to their own work. Davit will demonstrate the use of Jupyter notebooks, GitHub, and other relevant tools to ensure reproducibility. He will walk us through code documentation, data management, and version control with Git. And, he will share best practices for collaboration, peer review, and dissemination of results.\nDavit’s story starts here, but there is much more for the interested reader to discover. At certain points in this article, we will direct readers to other resources, namely a Jupyter notebook and GitHub repository which contain all the instructions, data and code necessary to reproduce Davit’s research. Together, these components offer a comprehensive overview of the thought process and technical implementation required for reproducibility. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, the principles remain consistent."

    "text": "Davit’s journey towards reproducibility\n\nMore power, please\nThe focus of my bachelor’s thesis was to better understand the initial spread of Covid-19 in China using deep learning algorithms. I was keen to make my work reproducible, but not only for my own sake. The “reproducibility crisis” is a well-documented problem in science as a whole,1 2 3 4 with studies suggesting that around one-third of social science studies published between the years 2010 and 2015 in top journals like Nature and Science could not be reproduced.5 Results that cannot be reproduced are not necessarily “wrong”. But, if findings cannot be reproduced, we cannot be sure of their validity.\nFor my own research project, I gathered all data and started working on my computer. After I built the algorithms to train the data, my first challenge to reproducibility was computational. I realised that training models on my local computer was taking far too long, and I needed a faster, more powerful solution to be able to submit my thesis in time. Fortunately, I could access the university server to train the algorithms. Once the training was complete, I could generate the results on my local computer, since producing maps and tables was not so demanding. However…\n\n\nBloody paths!\nIn switching between machines and computing environments, I soon encountered an issue with my code: the paths, or file directory locations, for the trained algorithms had been hardcoded! As I quickly discovered, hardcoding a path can lead to issues when the code is run in a different environment, as the path might not exist in the new environment.\nAs my code became longer, I overlooked the path names linked to algorithms that were generating the results. This mistake – which would have been easily corrected if spotted earlier – resulted in incorrect outputs. Such errors could have enormous (negative) implications in a public health context, where evidence-based decisions have real impacts on human lives. It was at this point that I realised that my code is the fundamental pillar of the validity of my empirical work. How can someone trust my work if they are not able to verify it?\nThe following dummy code demonstrates the hardcoding issue:\n```{python}\n# Hardcoded path\nfile_path = \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\"\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nIn the code above, a dummy file (toydata.csv) is used. The dummy file contains data on the prices of three different toys, but only the path of the file is relevant to this example. If the hardcoded file path – \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\" – exists on the machine being used, the code will run just fine. But, when run in a different environment without said path, the code will result in a \"File not found error\". Better code that uses relative paths can be written as:\n```{python}\n# Relative path\nimport os\n\nfile_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"toydata.csv\")\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nYou can see that this code has successfully imported data from the dataset toydata.csv and printed its two columns (toy and price) and three rows.\nThe following example is a simplified version of what happened when I wrote code to train several models, store the results and run a procedure to compare results with the predictive performance of a benchmark model:\n```{python}\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\"}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\"}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model1.csv', index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Load the model result and compare with benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model\nresult = pd.read_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model2.csv').iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nEverything looks fine at a glance. But, if you examine the code carefully, you may spot the problem. Initially, when I coded the procedure (training the model, saving and loading the results), I hardcoded the paths and had to change them for each tested model. First, I trained model2, a complex model, and tested it against the benchmark (70 > 50 → accepted). I repeated the procedure for model1 (a simple model). Its result was identical to model2, therefore I kept model1 following the parsimony principle.\nHowever, for the code line loading the result for the current model (line 5, second cell), I forgot to amend the path and so mistakenly loaded the result of model2. As a consequence, I accepted a model which should have been rejected. These wrong results were then spread further in the code, including all charts and maps and the conclusions of my analysis.\nA small coding error like this can therefore be fatal to an analysis. Below is the corrected code:\n```{python}\nimport os\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details (INCLUDING PATHS) in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model1.csv\")}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model2.csv\")}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv(current_model[\"path\"], index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Get the model result and compare with the benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model WITH a VARIABLE PATH\nresult = pd.read_csv(current_model[\"path\"]).iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nHere, the paths are stored with other model details (line 7–8, first cell). Therefore, we can use them as variables when we need them (e.g., line 16, first cell, and line 5, second cell). Now, when the current model is set to model1 (line 11, first cell), everything is automatically adjusted. Also, if the path details need to be changed, we only need to change them once and everything else is automatically adjusted and updated. The code now correctly states that model1 performs worse than the benchmark and is therefore rejected and we should keep model2, which performs best.\nI managed to catch this error in time, but it often can be difficult to spot our own mistakes. That is why making code available to others is crucial. A code review by a second (or third) pair of eyes can save everyone a lot of time and avoid spreading incorrect results and conclusions.\n\n\nSolving compatibility chaos with Docker\nOne might think that it would be easy to copy code from one computer to another and run it without difficulties, but it turns out to be a real headache. Different operating systems on my local computer and the university server caused multiple compatibility issues and it was very time-consuming to try to solve them. The university server was running on Ubuntu, a Linux distribution, which was not compatible with my macOS-based code editor. Moreover, the server did not support the Python programming language – and all the deep learning algorithm packages that I needed – in the same way as my macOS computer did.\nAs a remedy, I used Docker containers, which allowed me to create a virtual environment with all the necessary packages and dependencies installed. This way, I could integrate them with different hardware and use the processing power of that hardware. To get started with Docker, I first had to install it on my local computer. The installation process is straightforward and the Docker website provides step-by-step instructions for different operating systems. In fact, I found the Docker website very helpful, with lots of resources and tutorials available. Once Docker was installed, it was easy to create virtual environments for my project and work with my code, libraries, and packages, without any compatibility issues. Not only did Docker containers save me a lot of time and effort, but they could also make it easier for others to reproduce my work.\nBelow is an example of a Dockerfile which recreates an environment with Python 3.7 on Linux. It describes what, how, when and in which order operations should be carried out to generate the environment with all Python packages required to run the main Python script, main.py.\n\n\nAn example of a Dockerfile.\n\nIn this example, by downloading the project, including the Dockerfile, anyone can run main.py without installing packages or worrying about what OS was used for development or which Python version should be installed. You can view Docker as a great robot chef: show it a recipe (Dockerfile), provide the ingredients (project files), push the start button (to build the container) and wait to sample the results.\n\n\nWhy does nobody check your code?\nEven after implementing Docker, I still faced another challenge to reproducibility: making the verification process for my code easy enough that it could be done by anyone, without them needing a degree in computer science! Increasingly, there is an expectation for researchers to share their code so that results can be reproduced, but there are as yet no widely accepted or enforced standards on how to make code readable and reusable. However, if we are to embrace the concept of reproducibility, we must write and publish code under the assumption that someone, somewhere – boss, team member, journal reviewer, reader – will want to rerun our code. And, if we expect that someone will want to rerun our code (and hopefully check it), we should ensure that the code is readable and does not take too long to run.\nIf your code does take too long to run, some operations can often be accelerated – for example, by reducing the size of the datasets or by implementing computationally efficient data processing approaches (e.g., using PyTorch). Aim for a running time of a few minutes – or about as long as it takes to make a cup of tea or coffee. Of course, if data needs to be reduced to save computational time, the person rerunning your code won’t generate the same results as in your original analysis. This therefore will not lead to reproducibility, sensu stricto. However, as long as you state clearly what are the expected results from the reduced dataset, your peers can at least inspect your code and offer feedback, and this marks a step towards reproducibility.\nWe should also make sure our code is free from bugs – both the kind that might lead to errors in analysis and also those that stop the code running to completion. Bugs can occur for various reasons. For example, some code chunks written on a Windows machine may not properly execute on a macOS machine because the former uses \\ for file paths, while the latter uses /:\n```{python}\n# Path works on macOS/Linux\nwith open(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n\n# Path works only on Windows    \nwith open(r\"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n   print(f.read())\n```\n\nHere, only the macOS/Linux version works, since the code this capture was taken from was implemented on a Linux server. There are alternatives, however. The code below works on macOS, Linux, and also Windows machines:\n```{python}\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Path works on every OS: macOS/Linux/Windows\n# It will automatically replace the path to \"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\" when it runs on Windows\nwith open(Path(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\"), \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n```\n\nThe extra Python package, pathlib, is of course unnecessary if you build a Docker container for your project, as discussed in the previous section.\n\n\nJupyter, King of the Notebooks\nBy this stage in my project, I was feeling that I’d made good progress towards ensuring that my work would be reproducible. I’d expended a lot of effort to make my code readable, efficient, and also absent of bugs (or, at least, this is what I was hoping for). I’d also built a Docker container to allow others to replicate my computing environment and rerun the analysis. Still, I wanted to make sure there were no barriers that would prevent people – my supervisors, in particular – from being able to review the work I had done for my undergraduate thesis. What I wanted was a way to present a complete narrative of my project that was easy to understand and follow. For this, I turned to Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nJupyter notebooks combine Markdown text, code, and visualisations. The notebook itself can sit within an online directory of folders and files that contain all the data and code related to a project, allowing readers to understand the processes behind the work and also access the raw resources. From the notebook I produced, readers can see exactly what I did, how I did it, and what my results were.\nWhile creating my notebook, I was able to experiment with my code and iterate quickly. Code cells within a document can be run interactively, which allowed me to try out different approaches to solving a problem and see the results almost in real time. I could also get feedback from others and try out new ideas without having to spend a lot of time writing and debugging code.\n\n\nVersion control with Git and GitHub\nMy Jupyter notebook and associated folders and files are all available via GitHub. Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a central repository for storing and sharing code. With Git and GitHub, I was able to version my code and collaborate with others without the risk of losing any work. I really couldn’t afford to redo the entire year I spent on my dissertation!\nGit and GitHub are great for reproducibility. By sharing code via these platforms, others can access your work, verify it and reproduce your results without risking changing or, worse, destroying your work – whether partially or completely. These tools also make it easy for others to build on your work if they want to further develop your research. You can also use Git and GitHub to share or promote your results across a wider community. The ability to easily store and share your code also makes it easy to keep track of the different versions of your code and to see how your work has evolved.\nThe following illustration shows the tracking of very simple changes in a Python file. The previous version of the code is shown on the left; the new version is shown on the right. Additions and deletions are highlighted in green and red, and with + and - symbols, respectively.\n\n\nA simple example of GitHub version tracking."

    "text": "The deep learning challenge\nSo far, this article has dealt with barriers to reproducibility – and ways around them – that will apply to most, if not all, modern research projects. While I’d encourage any scientist to adopt these practices in their own work, it is important to stress that these alone cannot guarantee reproducibility. In cases where standard statistical procedures are used within statistical software packages, reproducibility is often achievable. However, in reality, even when following the same procedures, differences in outputs can occur, and identifying the reasons for this may be challenging. Cooking offers a simple analogy: subtle changes in room temperature or ingredient quality from one day to the next can impact the final product.\nOne of the challenges for research projects employing machine learning and deep learning algorithms is that outputs can be influenced by the randomness that is inherent in these approaches. Consider the four portraits below, generated by the Midjourney bot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nEach portrait looks broadly similar at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, critical differences emerge. These differences arise because deep learning models rely on numerous interconnected layers to learn intricate patterns and representations. Slight random perturbations, such as initial parameter values or changes in data samples, can propagate through the network, leading to different decisions during the learning process. As a result, even seemingly negligible randomness can amplify and manifest as considerable differences in the final output, as with the distinct features of the portraits.\nRandomness is not necessarily a bad thing – it mitigates overfitting and helps predictions to be generalised. However, it does present an additional barrier to reproducibility. If you cannot get the same results using the same raw materials – data, code, packages and computing environment – then you might have good reasons to doubt the validity of the findings.\nThere are many elements of an analysis in which randomness may be present and lead to different results. For example, in a classification (where your dependent variable is binary, e.g., success/failure with 1 and 0) or a regression (where your dependent variable is continuous, e.g., temperature measurements of 10.1°C, 2.8°C, etc.), you might need to split your data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to estimate the model (hyper)parameters and the testing set is used to compute the performance of the model. The way the split is usually operationalised is as a random selection of rows of your data. So, in principle, each time you split your data into training and testing sets, you may end up with different rows in each set. Differences in the training set may therefore lead to different values of the model (hyper)parameters and affect the predictive performance that is measured from the testing set. Also, differences in the testing set may lead to variations in the predictive performance scores, which in turn lead to potentially different interpretations and, ultimately, decisions if the results are used for that purpose.\nThis aspect of randomness in the training of models is relatively well known. But randomness may hide in other parts of code. One such example is illustrated below. Here, using Python, we set the seed number to 0 using np.random.seed(seed value). The random.seed() function from the package numpy (abbreviated np) saves the state of a random function so that it can create identical random numbers independently of the machine you use, and this is for any number of executions. A seed value is an initial input or starting point used by a pseudorandom number generator to generate a sequence of random numbers. It is often an integer or a timestamp. The number generator takes this seed value and uses it to produce a deterministic series of random numbers that appear to be random but can be recreated by using the same seed value. Without providing this seed value, the first execution of the function typically uses the current system time. The animation below generates two random arrays arr1 and arr2 using np.random.rand(3,2). Note that the values 3,2 indicate that we want random values for an array that has 3 rows and 2 columns.\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\n\n#Set the seed number e.g. to 0\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Set the seed number as before to get the same results\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nIf you run the code yourself multiple times, the values of arr1 and arr2 should remain identical. If this is not the case, check that the seed value is set to 0 in lines 4 and 11. These identical results are possible because we set the seed value to 0, which ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers each time the code is run. Now, let’s look at what happens if we remove the line np.random.seed(0):\n```{python}\n#Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nHere, the values of arr1 and arr2 will be different each time we run the code since the seed value was not set and is therefore changing over time.\nThis short code demonstrates how randomness that can be controlled by the seed value may affect your code. Therefore, unless randomness is required, e.g., to get some uncertainty in the results, setting the seed value will contribute to making your work reproducible. I also find it helpful to document the seed number I use in my code so that I can easily reproduce my findings in the future. If you are currently working on some code that involves random number generators, it might be worth checking your code and making all necessary changes. In our work (see code chunk 9 in the Jupyter notebook) we set the seed value in a general way, using a framework (config) so that our code always uses the same seed to train our algorithm."

    "text": "Reproducibility, or “the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as the original investigator”, is critical for sharing and building upon scientific findings. Reproducibility not only verifies the correctness of processes leading to results but also serves as a prerequisite for assessing generalisability to other datasets or contexts. This we refer to as replicability, or “the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but new data are collected”. Reproducibility, which is the focus of our work here, can be challenging – especially in the context of deep learning. This article, and associated material, aims to provide practical advice for overcoming these challenges.\nOur story begins with Davit Svanidze, a master’s degree student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). Davit’s efforts to make his bachelor’s thesis reproducible are what inspires this article, and we hope that readers will be able to learn from Davit’s experience and apply those learnings to their own work. Davit will demonstrate the use of Jupyter notebooks, GitHub, and other relevant tools to ensure reproducibility. He will walk us through code documentation, data management, and version control with Git. And, he will share best practices for collaboration, peer review, and dissemination of results.\nDavit’s story starts here, but there is much more for the interested reader to discover. At certain points in this article, we will direct readers to other resources, namely a Jupyter notebook and GitHub repository which contain all the instructions, data and code necessary to reproduce Davit’s research. Together, these components offer a comprehensive overview of the thought process and technical implementation required for reproducibility. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, the principles remain consistent."

    "text": "Davit’s journey towards reproducibility\n\nMore power, please\nThe focus of my bachelor’s thesis was to better understand the initial spread of Covid-19 in China using deep learning algorithms. I was keen to make my work reproducible, but not only for my own sake. The “reproducibility crisis” is a well-documented problem in science as a whole,1 2 3 4 with studies suggesting that around one-third of social science studies published between the years 2010 and 2015 in top journals like Nature and Science could not be reproduced.5 Results that cannot be reproduced are not necessarily “wrong”. But, if findings cannot be reproduced, we cannot be sure of their validity.\nFor my own research project, I gathered all data and started working on my computer. After I built the algorithms to train the data, my first challenge to reproducibility was computational. I realised that training models on my local computer was taking far too long, and I needed a faster, more powerful solution to be able to submit my thesis in time. Fortunately, I could access the university server to train the algorithms. Once the training was complete, I could generate the results on my local computer, since producing maps and tables was not so demanding. However…\n\n\nBloody paths!\nIn switching between machines and computing environments, I soon encountered an issue with my code: the paths, or file directory locations, for the trained algorithms had been hardcoded! As I quickly discovered, hardcoding a path can lead to issues when the code is run in a different environment, as the path might not exist in the new environment.\nAs my code became longer, I overlooked the path names linked to algorithms that were generating the results. This mistake – which would have been easily corrected if spotted earlier – resulted in incorrect outputs. Such errors could have enormous (negative) implications in a public health context, where evidence-based decisions have real impacts on human lives. It was at this point that I realised that my code is the fundamental pillar of the validity of my empirical work. How can someone trust my work if they are not able to verify it?\nThe following dummy code demonstrates the hardcoding issue:\n```{python}\n# Hardcoded path\nfile_path = \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\"\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nIn the code above, a dummy file (toydata.csv) is used. The dummy file contains data on the prices of three different toys, but only the path of the file is relevant to this example. If the hardcoded file path – \"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv\" – exists on the machine being used, the code will run just fine. But, when run in a different environment without said path, the code will result in a \"File not found error\". Better code that uses relative paths can be written as:\n```{python}\n# Relative path\nimport os\n\nfile_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"toydata.csv\")\ntry:\n    with open(file_path) as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        print(data)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found\")\n```\n\nYou can see that this code has successfully imported data from the dataset toydata.csv and printed its two columns (toy and price) and three rows.\nThe following example is a simplified version of what happened when I wrote code to train several models, store the results and run a procedure to compare results with the predictive performance of a benchmark model:\n```{python}\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\"}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\"}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model1.csv', index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Load the model result and compare with benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model\nresult = pd.read_csv('/all/notebooks/results-of-model2.csv').iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nEverything looks fine at a glance. But, if you examine the code carefully, you may spot the problem. Initially, when I coded the procedure (training the model, saving and loading the results), I hardcoded the paths and had to change them for each tested model. First, I trained model2, a complex model, and tested it against the benchmark (70 > 50 → accepted). I repeated the procedure for model1 (a simple model). Its result was identical to model2, therefore I kept model1 following the parsimony principle.\nHowever, for the code line loading the result for the current model (line 5, second cell), I forgot to amend the path and so mistakenly loaded the result of model2. As a consequence, I accepted a model which should have been rejected. These wrong results were then spread further in the code, including all charts and maps and the conclusions of my analysis.\nA small coding error like this can therefore be fatal to an analysis. Below is the corrected code:\n```{python}\nimport os\n# Set an arbitrary predictive performance value of a benchmark model\n# and accept/reject models if the results are above/below the value.\nbenchmark = 50\n# Set the model details (INCLUDING PATHS) in one place for a better overview\nmodel = {\n    \"model1\": {\"name\": \"model1\", \"type\": \"simple\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model1.csv\")}, \n    \"model2\": {\"name\": \"model2\", \"type\": \"complex\", \"path\": os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"results-of-model2.csv\")}\n}\n# Set the current model to \"model1\" to use it for training and check its results\ncurrent_model = model[\"model1\"]\n# Train a simple model for \"model1\" and a complex model for \"model2\"\n# Training result of the \"model1\" is 30 and for \"model2\" is 70\nmodel_structure = train(current_model[\"type\"])\n# Save the model and its result in a .csv file\nmodel_structure.to_csv(current_model[\"path\"], index=False)\n```\n```{python}\n# Get the model result and compare with the benchmark\nprint(\"Model name: {}\".format(current_model[\"name\"]))\nprint(\"Model type: {}\".format(current_model[\"type\"]))\n# Load the result of the current model WITH a VARIABLE PATH\nresult = pd.read_csv(current_model[\"path\"]).iloc[0, 0]\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(result))\n\nif result > benchmark:\n    print(\"\\033[3;32m>>> Result is better than the benchmark -> Accept the model and use it for calculations\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\033[3;31m>>> Result is NOT better than the benchmark -> Reject the model as it is not optimal\")\n```\n\nHere, the paths are stored with other model details (line 7–8, first cell). Therefore, we can use them as variables when we need them (e.g., line 16, first cell, and line 5, second cell). Now, when the current model is set to model1 (line 11, first cell), everything is automatically adjusted. Also, if the path details need to be changed, we only need to change them once and everything else is automatically adjusted and updated. The code now correctly states that model1 performs worse than the benchmark and is therefore rejected and we should keep model2, which performs best.\nI managed to catch this error in time, but it often can be difficult to spot our own mistakes. That is why making code available to others is crucial. A code review by a second (or third) pair of eyes can save everyone a lot of time and avoid spreading incorrect results and conclusions.\n\n\nSolving compatibility chaos with Docker\nOne might think that it would be easy to copy code from one computer to another and run it without difficulties, but it turns out to be a real headache. Different operating systems on my local computer and the university server caused multiple compatibility issues and it was very time-consuming to try to solve them. The university server was running on Ubuntu, a Linux distribution, which was not compatible with my macOS-based code editor. Moreover, the server did not support the Python programming language – and all the deep learning algorithm packages that I needed – in the same way as my macOS computer did.\nAs a remedy, I used Docker containers, which allowed me to create a virtual environment with all the necessary packages and dependencies installed. This way, I could integrate them with different hardware and use the processing power of that hardware. To get started with Docker, I first had to install it on my local computer. The installation process is straightforward and the Docker website provides step-by-step instructions for different operating systems. In fact, I found the Docker website very helpful, with lots of resources and tutorials available. Once Docker was installed, it was easy to create virtual environments for my project and work with my code, libraries, and packages, without any compatibility issues. Not only did Docker containers save me a lot of time and effort, but they could also make it easier for others to reproduce my work.\nBelow is an example of a Dockerfile which recreates an environment with Python 3.7 on Linux. It describes what, how, when and in which order operations should be carried out to generate the environment with all Python packages required to run the main Python script, main.py.\n\n\nAn example of a Dockerfile.\n\nIn this example, by downloading the project, including the Dockerfile, anyone can run main.py without installing packages or worrying about what OS was used for development or which Python version should be installed. You can view Docker as a great robot chef: show it a recipe (Dockerfile), provide the ingredients (project files), push the start button (to build the container) and wait to sample the results.\n\n\nWhy does nobody check your code?\nEven after implementing Docker, I still faced another challenge to reproducibility: making the verification process for my code easy enough that it could be done by anyone, without them needing a degree in computer science! Increasingly, there is an expectation for researchers to share their code so that results can be reproduced, but there are as yet no widely accepted or enforced standards on how to make code readable and reusable. However, if we are to embrace the concept of reproducibility, we must write and publish code under the assumption that someone, somewhere – boss, team member, journal reviewer, reader – will want to rerun our code. And, if we expect that someone will want to rerun our code (and hopefully check it), we should ensure that the code is readable and does not take too long to run.\nIf your code does take too long to run, some operations can often be accelerated – for example, by reducing the size of the datasets or by implementing computationally efficient data processing approaches (e.g., using PyTorch). Aim for a running time of a few minutes – or about as long as it takes to make a cup of tea or coffee. Of course, if data needs to be reduced to save computational time, the person rerunning your code won’t generate the same results as in your original analysis. This therefore will not lead to reproducibility, sensu stricto. However, as long as you state clearly what are the expected results from the reduced dataset, your peers can at least inspect your code and offer feedback, and this marks a step towards reproducibility.\nWe should also make sure our code is free from bugs – both the kind that might lead to errors in analysis and also those that stop the code running to completion. Bugs can occur for various reasons. For example, some code chunks written on a Windows machine may not properly execute on a macOS machine because the former uses \\ for file paths, while the latter uses /:\n```{python}\n# Path works on macOS/Linux\nwith open(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n\n# Path works only on Windows    \nwith open(r\"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n   print(f.read())\n```\n\nHere, only the macOS/Linux version works, since the code this capture was taken from was implemented on a Linux server. There are alternatives, however. The code below works on macOS, Linux, and also Windows machines:\n```{python}\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Path works on every OS: macOS/Linux/Windows\n# It will automatically replace the path to \"..\\..\\all\\notebooks\\toydata.csv\" when it runs on Windows\nwith open(Path(\"../../all/notebooks/toydata.csv\"), \"r\") as f:\n    print(f.read())\n```\n\nThe extra Python package, pathlib, is of course unnecessary if you build a Docker container for your project, as discussed in the previous section.\n\n\nJupyter, King of the Notebooks\nBy this stage in my project, I was feeling that I’d made good progress towards ensuring that my work would be reproducible. I’d expended a lot of effort to make my code readable, efficient, and also absent of bugs (or, at least, this is what I was hoping for). I’d also built a Docker container to allow others to replicate my computing environment and rerun the analysis. Still, I wanted to make sure there were no barriers that would prevent people – my supervisors, in particular – from being able to review the work I had done for my undergraduate thesis. What I wanted was a way to present a complete narrative of my project that was easy to understand and follow. For this, I turned to Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nJupyter notebooks combine Markdown text, code, and visualisations. The notebook itself can sit within an online directory of folders and files that contain all the data and code related to a project, allowing readers to understand the processes behind the work and also access the raw resources. From the notebook I produced, readers can see exactly what I did, how I did it, and what my results were.\nWhile creating my notebook, I was able to experiment with my code and iterate quickly. Code cells within a document can be run interactively, which allowed me to try out different approaches to solving a problem and see the results almost in real time. I could also get feedback from others and try out new ideas without having to spend a lot of time writing and debugging code.\n\n\nVersion control with Git and GitHub\nMy Jupyter notebook and associated folders and files are all available via GitHub. Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a central repository for storing and sharing code. With Git and GitHub, I was able to version my code and collaborate with others without the risk of losing any work. I really couldn’t afford to redo the entire year I spent on my dissertation!\nGit and GitHub are great for reproducibility. By sharing code via these platforms, others can access your work, verify it and reproduce your results without risking changing or, worse, destroying your work – whether partially or completely. These tools also make it easy for others to build on your work if they want to further develop your research. You can also use Git and GitHub to share or promote your results across a wider community. The ability to easily store and share your code also makes it easy to keep track of the different versions of your code and to see how your work has evolved.\nThe following illustration shows the tracking of very simple changes in a Python file. The previous version of the code is shown on the left; the new version is shown on the right. Additions and deletions are highlighted in green and red, and with + and - symbols, respectively.\n\n\nA simple example of GitHub version tracking."

    "text": "The deep learning challenge\nSo far, this article has dealt with barriers to reproducibility – and ways around them – that will apply to most, if not all, modern research projects. While I’d encourage any scientist to adopt these practices in their own work, it is important to stress that these alone cannot guarantee reproducibility. In cases where standard statistical procedures are used within statistical software packages, reproducibility is often achievable. However, in reality, even when following the same procedures, differences in outputs can occur, and identifying the reasons for this may be challenging. Cooking offers a simple analogy: subtle changes in room temperature or ingredient quality from one day to the next can impact the final product.\nOne of the challenges for research projects employing machine learning and deep learning algorithms is that outputs can be influenced by the randomness that is inherent in these approaches. Consider the four portraits below, generated by the Midjourney bot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Discord software, Midjourney bot.\n\nEach portrait looks broadly similar at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, critical differences emerge. These differences arise because deep learning models rely on numerous interconnected layers to learn intricate patterns and representations. Slight random perturbations, such as initial parameter values or changes in data samples, can propagate through the network, leading to different decisions during the learning process. As a result, even seemingly negligible randomness can amplify and manifest as considerable differences in the final output, as with the distinct features of the portraits.\nRandomness is not necessarily a bad thing – it mitigates overfitting and helps predictions to be generalised. However, it does present an additional barrier to reproducibility. If you cannot get the same results using the same raw materials – data, code, packages and computing environment – then you might have good reasons to doubt the validity of the findings.\nThere are many elements of an analysis in which randomness may be present and lead to different results. For example, in a classification (where your dependent variable is binary, e.g., success/failure with 1 and 0) or a regression (where your dependent variable is continuous, e.g., temperature measurements of 10.1°C, 2.8°C, etc.), you might need to split your data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to estimate the model (hyper)parameters and the testing set is used to compute the performance of the model. The way the split is usually operationalised is as a random selection of rows of your data. So, in principle, each time you split your data into training and testing sets, you may end up with different rows in each set. Differences in the training set may therefore lead to different values of the model (hyper)parameters and affect the predictive performance that is measured from the testing set. Also, differences in the testing set may lead to variations in the predictive performance scores, which in turn lead to potentially different interpretations and, ultimately, decisions if the results are used for that purpose.\nThis aspect of randomness in the training of models is relatively well known. But randomness may hide in other parts of code. One such example is illustrated below. Here, using Python, we set the seed number to 0 using np.random.seed(seed value). The random.seed() function from the package numpy (abbreviated np) saves the state of a random function so that it can create identical random numbers independently of the machine you use, and this is for any number of executions. A seed value is an initial input or starting point used by a pseudorandom number generator to generate a sequence of random numbers. It is often an integer or a timestamp. The number generator takes this seed value and uses it to produce a deterministic series of random numbers that appear to be random but can be recreated by using the same seed value. Without providing this seed value, the first execution of the function typically uses the current system time. The animation below generates two random arrays arr1 and arr2 using np.random.rand(3,2). Note that the values 3,2 indicate that we want random values for an array that has 3 rows and 2 columns.\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\n\n#Set the seed number e.g. to 0\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Set the seed number as before to get the same results\nnp.random.seed(0)\n# Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nIf you run the code yourself multiple times, the values of arr1 and arr2 should remain identical. If this is not the case, check that the seed value is set to 0 in lines 4 and 11. These identical results are possible because we set the seed value to 0, which ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers each time the code is run. Now, let’s look at what happens if we remove the line np.random.seed(0):\n```{python}\n#Generate random array\narr1 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"Array 1:\")\n## print(arr1)\n\n#Generate another random array\narr2 = np.random.rand(3,2)\n## print(\"\\nArray 2:\")\n## print(arr2)\n```\n\nHere, the values of arr1 and arr2 will be different each time we run the code since the seed value was not set and is therefore changing over time.\nThis short code demonstrates how randomness that can be controlled by the seed value may affect your code. Therefore, unless randomness is required, e.g., to get some uncertainty in the results, setting the seed value will contribute to making your work reproducible. I also find it helpful to document the seed number I use in my code so that I can easily reproduce my findings in the future. If you are currently working on some code that involves random number generators, it might be worth checking your code and making all necessary changes. In our work (see code chunk 9 in the Jupyter notebook) we set the seed value in a general way, using a framework (config) so that our code always uses the same seed to train our algorithm."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, I have been trying to force myself to do all my coding in a consistent coding framework. Mostly this means that I want to switch completely to tidyverse/dplyr-style coding. Mostly for reasons of readability and teaching, but it also has a slight OCD-component for myself. I find it weird to use the apply-family of functions within the dplyr-pipes. Mostly, this transition is effortless, however, when it comes to applying some functions on “rows” (values spread across different columns on one row) the process has been painful. It took me much time to figure out how to do it. And I am still not entirely confident in my abilities. I understand the tidy data principles, but something like rowmeans or counting how many variables have missing values for a particular individual (row) is so common that I imagined it to have a bigger role in the dplyr-framework.\nI’ll start off with calculating the means of variables for all rows using many different ways using the dplyr-programming framework. I’ll do it for all variables, plus a selection of variables. Note: of course, calculating rowmeans is rather easy and rowMeans is an obvious and easy choice; I have chosen it, though, so that it is also easy to see what is going on in the other possibilities.\n\npackages\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\ndata\nWe’ll use this dataframe:\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  var1 = c(1, 2),\n  var2 = c(2, 4),\n  var3 = c(3, 6)\n)\nselect_vars <- c(\"var2\", \"var3\")\n\n\n\nrowmeans\nThe easiest way is to use the base R rowmeans function:\n\ndf %>% mutate(mean_all = rowMeans(.),\n              mean_sel = rowMeans(select(., select_vars)))\n\nWarning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.\nℹ In argument: `mean_sel = rowMeans(select(., select_vars))`.\nCaused by warning:\n! Using an external vector in selections was deprecated in tidyselect 1.1.0.\nℹ Please use `all_of()` or `any_of()` instead.\n  # Was:\n  data %>% select(select_vars)\n\n  # Now:\n  data %>% select(all_of(select_vars))\n\nSee <https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/faq-external-vector.html>.\n\n\n  var1 var2 var3 mean_all mean_sel\n1    1    2    3        2      2.5\n2    2    4    6        4      5.0\n\n\nEasy. Here I would also consider rowMeans(.[select_vars]) but that clashes with my own rule described above to try to get everything within one framework. rowMeans should be the preferred choice I think.\n\n\napply\nWe can do the same using the apply-functions. This is just to highlight the example. It is clear that there is no reason to do this because rowMeans does an excellent (and faster) job.\n\ndf %>% mutate(mean_all = apply(., 1, mean),\n              mean_sel = apply(select(., select_vars), 1, mean))\n\n  var1 var2 var3 mean_all mean_sel\n1    1    2    3        2      2.5\n2    2    4    6        4      5.0\n\n\nAlthough this again fine, I’d rather not do this option, because then, for instance in teaching, you would also have to explain a bit about the apply functions. I think it is easier to keep everything within one framework, but this is certainly not needed.\nSo let’s try frameworks that are more “consistent” with the tidyverse-framework; pmap and rowwise. It took me a long time to get this to work; the pmap-documentation is not (yet) very extensive.\n\n\npmap\nThe map-functions from purrr seem handy in this respect.\nThis is the solution, and we’ll see a breakdown later (mostly for myself because I didn’t quite understand it initially).\n\ndf %>% mutate(mean_all = pmap_dbl(., function(...) mean(c(...))),\n              mean_sel = pmap_dbl(select(., select_vars), \n                                  function(...) mean(c(...))))\n\n  var1 var2 var3 mean_all mean_sel\n1    1    2    3        2      2.5\n2    2    4    6        4      5.0\n\n\nLet’s see what is going on by looking at the easier cases of map and map2.The map-function applies some function to each element from a list. map only uses one list. With the first argument you can specify the variable name of a dataframe that will be seen as a list.\n\nmap\n\ndf %>% mutate(mean_var2 = map_dbl(var2, mean))\n\n  var1 var2 var3 mean_var2\n1    1    2    3         2\n2    2    4    6         4\n\n\nIt is obviously not very sensible to calculate a mean from one number. So let’s try two numbers:\n\n\nmap2\nWith map2 you can specify two lists, again by using variable names from the dataframe, and map will iterate through all the “rows” (or elements of the lists). If we do the following:\n\ndf %>% mutate(mean_var2_3 = map2_dbl(var2, var3, mean))\n\n  var1 var2 var3 mean_var2_3\n1    1    2    3           2\n2    2    4    6           4\n\n\nThe code works, but we don’t get the results we want. We get the mean of (of the row of) var2 only, not the mean of the row of var2 and var3. I think this is because the function mean doesn’t know what to do with the second argument, var3, provided to it. It certainly doesn’t see it as a number for the calculation of the mean, because all that information is passed to mean with the first argument var2. So it will only calculate a mean of var2 (for each element in the list of var2).\nLet’s improve:\n\ndf %>% mutate(mean_var2_3 = map2_dbl(var2, var3, function(x, y) mean(c(x,y))))\n\n  var1 var2 var3 mean_var2_3\n1    1    2    3         2.5\n2    2    4    6         5.0\n\n\nThis does what we want! The trick here is that in the previous case, mean didn’t see the two arguments (var2 and var3) as numbers to be used to calculate the mean for. So now we have to specify directly, that both var2 and var3 are numbers that need to be combined (by using c()). So the mean function has only one argument passed to it, namely a combination of the numbers in var2 and var3 (for each row!).\n\n\npmap\nThe pmap function at the start of this section makes more sense now (at least to me). If we want to make use of more than 2 variables (or lists), we can use the pmap function. We need to use ... rather than specifying the columns/lists separately. In the end, we combine all the variables with c(). The nice thing now, is that we can also use the select_vars information that we had stored\n\ndf %>% mutate(mean_all = pmap_dbl(., function(...) mean(c(...))),\n              mean_sel = pmap_dbl(select(., select_vars), \n                                  function(...) mean(c(...))))\n\n  var1 var2 var3 mean_all mean_sel\n1    1    2    3        2      2.5\n2    2    4    6        4      5.0\n\n\n\n\n\nrowwise\ndplyr also has its rowwise function. It works much less well as you would expect from such a simple sounding function. This is the “solution”.\n\nall_vars_quo <- quo(c(var1, var2, var3))\nselect_vars_quo <- quo(c(var2, var3))\n\ndf %>% \n  rowwise() %>% \n  mutate(mean_all = mean(!!all_vars_quo),\n         mean_sel = mean(!!select_vars_quo))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n# Rowwise: \n   var1  var2  var3 mean_all mean_sel\n  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>\n1     1     2     3        2      2.5\n2     2     4     6        4      5  \n\n\nI don’t think this is ideal at all. This may be due to my limited understanding of quosures and non-standard evaluation (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/programming.html). Also I wonder whether rowwise is really meant for the tricks we’re after; it’s somehow strongly tied to do, which seems to be related to (statistical) model building mostly.\nAlso, a huge benefit for me is the “readability” of tidyverse/dplyr R-code (for myself and for teaching). With the !! and quo the code is much less readable I think. I think it is unfortunate that we can’t use the select_vars <- c(\"var2\", \"var3\") bit, that we have been able to use in all other possibilities.\nI think that it would be ideal if there was a rowwise function that would work in this way (not unlike mutate_at):\n\ndf %>% \n  rowwise() %>% \n  mutate(mean_all = mean(.),\n         mean_sel = mean(select(., select_vars))\n\nError: <text>:5:0: unexpected end of input\n3:   mutate(mean_all = mean(.),\n4:          mean_sel = mean(select(., select_vars))\n  ^\n\n\nI am probably not understanding something fundamental about non-standard evaluation and I probably fail to see what rowwise is for, but I do think the above code reads more like the rowMeans, apply, and pmap coding. If anyone can tell me why this is not an option, I would very much like to hear! Alternatively, I can just not worry, be grateful for the alternatives, and move along.\n\n\ntesting for speed\nSimilar to this post by Winston Chang, I will now test these alternatives for speed (while shamelessly copying the code by Chang):\n\n# https://rpubs.com/wch/200398\nrun_benchmark <- function(nrow) {\n  # Make some data\n  df <- data.frame(\n    x = rnorm(nrow),\n    y = runif(nrow),\n    z = runif(nrow)\n  )\n  \n  res <- list(\n    rowMeans = system.time(mutate(df, mean_all = rowMeans(df))),\n    apply = system.time(mutate(df, mean_all = apply(df, 1, mean))),\n    pmap = system.time(\n      mutate(df, mean_all = pmap_dbl(df, function(...) mean(c(...))))),\n    pmap_list = system.time(\n      mutate(df, mean_all = pmap_dbl(as.list(df), function(...) mean(c(...))))),\n    # as.list is faster (https://rpubs.com/wch/200398)\n    rowwise = system.time(\n      mutate(rowwise(df), mean_all = mean(c(x, y, z))))\n  )\n  \n  # Get elapsed times\n  res <- lapply(res, `[[`, \"elapsed\")\n\n  # Add nrow to front\n  res <- c(nrow = nrow, res)\n  res\n}\n\n# Run the benchmarks for various size data\nall_times <- lapply(1:5, function(n) {\n  run_benchmark(10^n)\n})\n\n# Convert to data frame\ntimes <- lapply(all_times, as.data.frame)\ntimes <- do.call(rbind, times)\n\n\n\nvisualise results\n\ntimes_long <- times %>% gather(rowMeans, apply, pmap, pmap_list, rowwise, \n                               key = \"Function\", value = \"Time\")\n\nggplot(times_long, aes(x = nrow, y = Time, \n                       colour = reorder(Function, Time, mean))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_x_continuous(trans = \"log10\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Number of rows\", y = \"Time (seconds)\")\n\n\n\n\nrowMeans is a clear winner, but can obviously not be used when you have to do something differently to the rows than means. apply is a bit faster than the pmap-functions. pmap performs better than pmap list (which is opposite to the situation here.rowwise seems to be the least ideal alternative, both in terms of time needed and the code. For other functions than calculating means, I will probably stick to (p)map, because that also lends itself better to statistical modelling."

    "text": "Humans are a peculiar species. On the one hand, we have evolved like all other species, forming a branch of the tree of life along with the rest of the animal kingdom. A complete understanding of humans and their place in the world thus requires we take an evolutionary perspective. On the other hand, the remarkable cultural diversity observed among human populations, combined with our apparent agency—our ability to decide whether or not to act on the decisions we make—complicates matters enormously, and seems to place us outside of nature. How, for example, can we explain the decision to actively avoid having children as a trait that evolved by the action of natural selection? In addition, there are some questions that do not seem to require an evolutionary explanation such as: how do you humans make meaning in their lives? Or is socialized health care a good idea? Or what are the moral and legal implications of new reproductive technologies? In other words, while an evolutionary perspective is necessary for a complete explanation of human behaviour, such a perspective is not always essential. Indeed, many areas of the social sciences do very well without a specific evolutionary orientation. It is also notable that some social scientists actively resist the application of evolutionary approaches within their discipline. Some of this resistance reflects a dissatisfaction with the nature and quality of the evolutionary approaches on offer, particularly those emanating from within psychology. Sometimes, however, resistance seems to be built on faulty ideologically-driven assumptions about what an evolutionary-oriented approach entails. The most productive way forward is to adopt a pluralist biosocial perspective to the study of human behaviour; one that draws on a number of disciplines within the natural and social sciences, without any attempt to reduce one to the other, or deny the existence and importance of any particular discipline."

    "text": "Description\nSocial influence has a prominent role in theories on fertility, implying that people’s reproductive decision-making is affected by the choices and behaviours of others. Multiple social influence mechanisms are thought to change people’s fertility behaviour, including social learning, social contagion, social capital, and social pressure. Comprehensively investigating these mechanisms of social influence in contemporary populations has been difficult, and most findings stem from convenience samples, qualitative studies, or studies focussing on single mechanisms. Here we examine the opportunity for social influence by these different mechanisms simultaneously using a unique representative sample of 706 Dutch women reporting on 17,650 social relations (obtained via the LISS panel). In particular, we investigated variation in the composition of the network in terms of fertility-relevant characteristics, including the number of childfree individuals in the personal network, the number of people with (young) children, and the number of people that can help you with child care. Characterising variation in these traits in personal networks gives unique insights into the opportunities for social influence. Follow-up studies will address how such variation shapes fertility behaviour."

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nEducation is a strong driver of whether and when women become mothers. Many different and contradicting mechanisms have been proposed to explain why highly educated women are more likely to remain childless and become mothers at higher ages than less educated women. The demands on data to disentangle these mechanisms are extraordinary, and no dataset exists that allows for this. Microsimulation models can help in this situation by explicitly modelling the mechanisms and comparing the outcomes of the models to real-world outcomes. The simulation models presented here simulate fertility outcomes over the life courses of agents based on behavioural factors, such preferences and partnership trajectories, and biological factors that determine the ability to have children, such as the age at sterility, fecundability, and intrauterine mortality. To parametrise the models, we use administrative data from Social Statistics Netherlands, survey data from the LISS panel for the behavioural factors, and findings from reproductive medicine for the biological parameters. To estimate unknown parameters in the models (for which no data are available), we use Approximate Bayesian Computation. This is computationally rather demanding which is why we have used supercomputers. Our simulations reproduce the pattern of unintended childlessness strongly varying across women with different educational levels. Despite higher educated women preferring to have children at a later age, our simulations showed that these preferences hardly played a role in explaining childlessness. The higher age at cohabitation was the main explanation for the higher unintended childlessness among highly educated women. We discuss how these models can be used to explain the surprising reversal in gradient between education and fertility that is observed in Scandinavian countries. We end by discussing the advantages and drawbacks of our simulation approach and how it can contribute to family sociology"

Unfortunately, obtaining information on the social environment, for instance through collecting personal network data, is difficult and often burdensome to participants. In this talk, I will first report on my experiences with collecting large personal network data (25 alters) from a representative sample of 758 Dutch women. I’ll then address some of the important design choices and reflect on the quality of the data that was gathered. In the second part of the talk, I use these data and simulation studies to address the trade-offs researchers face when designing network studies between the burden to respondents and the reliability of structural and compositional characteristics of networks. In the last part of the talk, I discuss how this study contributes to debates on the usefulness of the concept “friend” and the break-down of kin networks in contemporary populations."

    "text": "Description\nThe fertility decline associated with economic development has been attributed to a host of interrelated causes including the rising costs of children with industrialization, and shifts in family structure. One hypothesis is that kin may impart more pro-natal information within their networks than non-kin, and that this effect may be exacerbated in networks with high kin-density where greater social conformity would be expected. In this study, we tested these ideas using large personal networks (25 associates of the respondent) collected from a sample of Dutch women (N = 706). Kin (parents) were perceived to exert slightly more social pressure to have children than non-kin, although dense networks were not associated with greater pressure. In contrast, women reported talking to friends about having children to a greater extent than kin, although greater kin-density in the network increased the likelihood of women reporting that they could talk to kin about having children. Both consanguineal and affinal kin could be asked to help with child-care to a greater extent than friends and other non-kin. Overall, there was mixed evidence that kin were more likely to offer pro-natal information than non-kin, and better evidence to suggest that kin were considered to be a better source of child-care support."

Different mechanisms of influence are distinguished, including social learning, pressure, contagion, and support. I’ll discuss to what extent these mechanisms can explain why there is such a strong positive association between education and being childfree. Data come from the LISS-panel, a representative, longitudinal internet panel in the Netherlands. Large personal networks (of 25 alters) were collected for ~750 Duch women. I’ll also highlight a new survey-tool that allows for a efficient and ‘fun’ way of collecting personal network data, typically a burdensome task."

    "text": "Description\nSociology relies heavily on the idea that social interactions with people in the network are important in changing minds and behaviours. Information on the personal networks of individuals is therefore of great interest to many researchers. Unfortunately, such data are rarely collected because of the respondent burden of naming many individuals in their network and repeatedly answering questions about these individuals. Using GENSI—a recently developed (freely available) graphical tool to collect personal networks—we collected large personal network data from a representative sample of Dutch women between 18 and 40 (N = 758) through the LISS-panel; a longitudinal internet survey of Dutch individuals. Respondents had to list exactly 25 names of individuals with whom they had communicated within the last year, and answered several questions about these individuals, including demographic characteristics and fertility outcomes. In this talk, we show the workings of GENSI; report on the experiences respondents had with the survey; and reflect on the quality of the responses. Our results show that collecting large personal networks is feasible through this method without burdening the respondents too much, generating unique data. The value of data on large personal networks in representative samples will be discussed for sociological questions."

De biologische klok tikt door, maar de medische vooruitgang biedt nog perspectief, toch? Journalist Larissa Pans gaat in gesprek met filosoof Stine Jensen, gynaecoloog Annemieke Hoek en socioloog Gert Stulp over de oorzaken, mogelijkheden en dilemma’s rond de ‘opgerekte’ vruchtbaarheid. Wat zijn de oorzaken en gevolgen van het uitstelgedrag met betrekking tot het krijgen van kinderen van de huidige generatie? Door de medisch vooruitgang lijken de opties oneindig: extreem laat moederschap door IVF, het invriezen van eicellen… We gaan er misschien ook steeds meer vanuit dat er wel iets mogelijk moet zijn en nemen de afnemende vruchtbaarheid niet serieus genoeg. Hier kleven natuurlijk ook weer allerlei gevolgen en dilemma’s aan. Het te grote geloof in de maakbaarheid van je eigen vruchtbaarheid, ook ingegeven door het idee dat als het op natuurlijke wijze niet lukt, er nog altijd ivf is. Überhaupt is er een groot geloof in de maakbaarheid van je eigen leven, ook op gebied van relatie en gezondheid. Wat is er allemaal mogelijk op gebied van vruchtbaarheid?

    "text": "Description\nEducation is a strong driver of whether and when women become mothers. Many different and contradicting mechanisms have been proposed to explain why highly educated women are more likely to remain childless and become mothers at higher ages than less educated women. The demands on data to disentangle these mechanisms are extraordinary, and no dataset exists that allows for this. Microsimulation models can help in this situation by explicitly modelling the mechanisms and comparing the outcomes of the models to real-world outcomes. The simulation models presented here simulate fertility outcomes over the life courses of agents based on behavioural factors, such preferences and partnership trajectories, and biological factors that determine the ability to have children, such as the age at sterility, fecundability, and intrauterine mortality. To parametrise the models, we use administrative data from Social Statistics Netherlands, survey data from the LISS panel for the behavioural factors, and findings from reproductive medicine for the biological parameters. Our models show that unintended childlessness strongly differs between women with different educational levels. Despite higher educated women preferring to have children at a later age, our simulations showed that these preferences hardly played a role in explaining childlessness. The higher age at cohabitation was the main explanation for the higher unintended childlessness among highly educated women. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of our simulation approach and how it can contribute to family sociology."

An understanding of humans would most certainly require an evolutionary perspective from such a stance. On the other hand, the remarkably cultural diversity observed in humans, combined with the apparent agency in decision-making, would suggest that such an evolutionary perspective is not essential. How to study humans evolutionary is therefore not straightforward, and indeed, there are several evolutionary approaches on offer in the study of human behaviour. In this talk, I’ll discuss the merits of these approaches, and apply them to reproductive behaviour in contemporary, industrialised populations."

Maar in welke mate we de evolutionaire biologie kunnen gebruiken om menselijk gedrag te duiden, daar zijn grote meningsverschillen over. Tijdens deze lezing, zet ik de diverse evolutionaire stromingen over menselijk gedrag uiteen en hoe deze doorgaans te werk gaan. Van de evolutionaire psychologie, waar het oeroude brein centraal staat, tot de gedragsecologie, dat zich vooral richt op wie de meeste kinderen krijgen, tot het culturele evolutionisme, waarin onze sterke neiging om van anderen te leren centraal staat. Deze wetenschappelijke perspectieven verschillen sterk in hun antwoord op belangrijke vragen als: evolueert de mens nog? Gedragen mensen in moderne maatschappijen zich nog adaptief? Hebben wij een oeroud brein? Hopelijk biedt de lezing de participant enige handvatten om met spraakmakende, evolutionair getinte nieuwsartikelen om te gaan (bijvoorbeeld: ‘vrouwen houden van winkelen vanwege evolutie’, of ‘het Paleodieet is het enige juiste dieet’)."

Different mechanisms of influence are distinguished, including social learning, pressure, contagion, and support. I’ll discuss to what extent these mechanisms can explain why there is such a strong positive association between education and being childfree. Data come from the LISS-panel, a representative, longitudinal internet panel in the Netherlands. Large personal networks (of 25 alters) were collected for ~750 Duch women. I’ll also highlight a new survey-tool that allows for a efficient and ‘fun’ way of collecting personal network data, typically a burdensome task."

    "text": "Description\nThe fertility decline associated with economic development has been attributed to a host of interrelated causes including the rising costs of children with industrialization, and shifts in family structure. One hypothesis is that kin may impart more pro-natal information within their networks than non-kin, and that this effect may be exacerbated in networks with high kin-density where greater social conformity would be expected. In this study, we tested these ideas using large personal networks (25 associates of the respondent) collected from a sample of Dutch women (N = 706). Kin (parents) were perceived to exert slightly more social pressure to have children than non-kin, although dense networks were not associated with greater pressure. In contrast, women reported talking to friends about having children to a greater extent than kin, although greater kin-density in the network increased the likelihood of women reporting that they could talk to kin about having children. Both consanguineal and affinal kin could be asked to help with child-care to a greater extent than friends and other non-kin. Overall, there was mixed evidence that kin were more likely to offer pro-natal information than non-kin, and better evidence to suggest that kin were considered to be a better source of child-care support."

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nThe Dutch have a remarkable history when it comes to height. From being one of the shortest European populations in the 18th Century, the Dutch grew some 20 centimetres and are currently the tallest population in the world. Wealth, hygiene, and diet have all contributed to this increase in height. In addition, there is some research to suggest that natural selection also favours taller heights among the Dutch. Caution is warranted here, though, as this work is based only on phenotypic associations between people’s height and number of offspring in a contemporary population. As such, it can say little about the increase in height over the past centuries. It is also apparent that the response to selection of observed selection gradients could only minimally account for the increase in height. The calculation of such a response, however, involves making a range of assumptions on height across history that are and perhaps can never be verified. Simulation studies can help us here as they allow us to vary our assumptions and so verify their consequences. The aim of this research is to simulate the evolution of height in the Netherlands across the last two hundred years. Effects of the environment and the heritability of height will vary across time based on estimates from other studies. The strength of selection can be varied across men and women, as well as mating patterns that change the response to selection (e.g., assortative mating). By parametrising the model by observed heights across history, and by varying the strength of selection, we aim to get insight on plausible estimates of how much natural selection has contributed to the major increase in stature in the Netherlands. Only by using a combination of methods and insights from different disciplines, including biology, demography, and history are we potentially able to address how much of the increase in height is due natural selection and other causes."

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nThe western world is very different from those environments in which our species has roamed around for most of the time. Biology 101 tells us that with rapidly changing environments, (genetic) adaptation may fall behind rendering animals maladapted or “mismatched” to their environments. Some forms of human behaviour in the industrialised world might be similarly “mismatched”, and this idea is gaining in popularity in the medical and psychological sciences. In this talk, we try to argue the following points: 1) although the idea of “mismatch” provides a valuable perspective, it is often rather uncritically used; 2) the predictive ability of this perspective is often limited; even in rather clear cases such as obesity; 3) supposed cases of mismatch are often not backed up by appropriate empirical data; 4) this perspective is more valuable for the peculiarities of our body than of our mind. We conclude that the “mismatch” perspective is valuable in understanding (some) contemporary human behaviour, but that its use should be more stringent. Instances of surprising human behaviour shouldn’t uncritically be linked to mismatch. We further argue that maladaptive behaviour in contemporary populations is not so much a consequence of a “stone-age mind”, but rather of a mind containing fundamentally novel ideas."

I’ll discuss the trade-offs researchers face when designing network studies between the burden to respondents and the reliability of characteristics of networks. Data quality is further discussed, including the usefulness of the concept “friend”.

    "text": "Description\nDemography and sociology have produced a sophisticated body of work on fertility outcomes, i.e., whether, why, and when people have children. Such research has uncovered many characteristics underlying fertility. Unfortunately, traditional ways of statistical analyses means that results are difficult to compare across studies and that we have little understanding on the (relative) importance of these characteristics. In light of the credibility crisis that has taken hold of many other fields and disciplines, one might similarly worry about the robustness of findings in demography. In this talk I will argue that a focus on predictive ability and on microsimulation will advance fertility research and make it more reliable. In the first part of the talk, I will make a plea for reporting out-of-sample predictive ability. I argue that this form of predictive ability i) is the most relevant effect size we should be interested in, because it is a measure of how well our theories do in practice, ii) prevents overfitting and is less susceptible to researcher degrees of freedom, iii) facilitates comparison between theory and data-driven approaches, and iv) allows for prediction benchmarks which have facilitated cumulative knowledge in other disciplines. In the second part of the talk, I will discuss how microsimulation models of fertility can advance existing research. A simulation model that includes findings from reproductive medicine on the ability to have children (e.g., the age at sterility, fecundability) is developed to quantify to what extent higher levels of childlessness among highly educated Dutch women are explained by preferences and partnership trajectories. I conclude by arguing that a shift towards prediction in combination with theory-driven microsimulation models increases the robustness of findings and allows a unique perspective on the state of fertility research."

    "text": "Description\nEducation is a strong driver of whether and when women become mothers. Many different and contradicting mechanisms have been proposed to explain why highly educated women are more likely to remain childless and become mothers at higher ages than less educated women. The demands on data to disentangle these mechanisms are extraordinary, and no dataset exists that allows for this. Microsimulation models can help in this situation by explicitly modelling the mechanisms and comparing the outcomes of the models to real-world outcomes. The simulation models presented here simulate fertility outcomes over the life courses of agents based on behavioural factors, such preferences and partnership trajectories, and biological factors that determine the ability to have children, such as the age at sterility, fecundability, and intrauterine mortality. To parametrise the models, we use administrative data from Social Statistics Netherlands, survey data from the LISS panel for the behavioural factors, and findings from reproductive medicine for the biological parameters. To estimate unknown parameters in the models (for which no data are available), we use Approximate Bayesian Computation. This is computationally rather demanding which is why we have used supercomputers. Our simulations reproduce the pattern of unintended childlessness strongly varying across women with different educational levels. Despite higher educated women preferring to have children at a later age, our simulations showed that these preferences hardly played a role in explaining childlessness. The higher age at cohabitation was the main explanation for the higher unintended childlessness among highly educated women. We discuss how these models can be used to explain the surprising reversal in gradient between education and fertility that is observed in Scandinavian countries. We end by discussing the advantages and drawbacks of our simulation approach and how it can contribute to family sociology"

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nDemography and sociology have produced a sophisticated body of work on fertility outcomes, i.e., whether, why, and when people have children. Such research has uncovered many characteristics underlying fertility. Unfortunately, traditional ways of statistical analyses means that results are difficult to compare across studies and that we have little understanding on the (relative) importance of these characteristics. In light of the credibility crisis that has taken hold of many other fields and disciplines, one might similarly worry about the robustness of findings in demography. In this talk I will argue that a focus on predictive ability and on microsimulation will advance fertility research and make it more reliable.\nIn the first part of the talk, I will make a plea for reporting out-of-sample predictive ability. I argue that this form of predictive ability i) is the most relevant effect size we should be interested in, because it is a measure of how well our theories do in practice, ii) prevents overfitting and is less susceptible to researcher degrees of freedom, iii) facilitates comparison between theory and data-driven approaches, and iv) allows for prediction benchmarks which have facilitated cumulative knowledge in other disciplines.\nIn the second part of the talk, I will discuss how microsimulation models of fertility can advance existing research. A simulation model that includes findings from reproductive medicine on the ability to have children (e.g., the age at sterility, fecundability) is developed to quantify to what extent higher levels of childlessness among highly educated Dutch women are explained by preferences and partnership trajectories.\nI conclude by arguing that a shift towards prediction in combination with theory-driven microsimulation models increases the robustness of findings and allows a unique perspective on the state of fertility research."

Unfortunately, obtaining information on the social environment, for instance through collecting personal network data, is difficult and often burdensome to participants. In this talk, I will first report on my experiences with collecting large personal network data (25 alters) from a representative sample of Dutch women. I’ll discuss the trade-offs researchers face when designing network studies between the burden to respondents and the reliability of characteristics of networks. Data quality is further discussed, including the usefulness of the concept “friend”. In the second part of the talk, I use these data to test evolutionary and sociological ideas about the breakdown of kin networks in contemporary populations as an explanation for the fertility decline.

    "text": "Description\nThe western world is very different from those environments in which our species has roamed around for most of the time. Biology 101 tells us that with rapidly changing environments, (genetic) adaptation may fall behind rendering animals maladapted or “mismatched” to their environments. Some forms of human behaviour in the industrialised world might be similarly “mismatched”, and this idea is gaining in popularity in the medical and psychological sciences. In this talk, we try to argue the following points: 1) although the idea of “mismatch” provides a valuable perspective, it is often rather uncritically used; 2) the predictive ability of this perspective is often limited; even in rather clear cases such as obesity; 3) supposed cases of mismatch are often not backed up by appropriate empirical data; 4) this perspective is more valuable for the peculiarities of our body than of our mind. We conclude that the “mismatch” perspective is valuable in understanding (some) contemporary human behaviour, but that its use should be more stringent. Instances of surprising human behaviour shouldn’t uncritically be linked to mismatch. We further argue that maladaptive behaviour in contemporary populations is not so much a consequence of a “stone-age mind”, but rather of a mind containing fundamentally novel ideas."

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nThe Dutch have a remarkable history when it comes to height. From being one of the shortest European populations in the 18th Century, the Dutch grew some 20 centimetres and are currently the tallest population in the world. Wealth, hygiene, and diet have all contributed to this increase in height. In addition, there is some research to suggest that natural selection also favours taller heights among the Dutch. Caution is warranted here, though, as this work is based only on phenotypic associations between people’s height and number of offspring in a contemporary population. As such, it can say little about the increase in height over the past centuries. It is also apparent that the response to selection of observed selection gradients could only minimally account for the increase in height. The calculation of such a response, however, involves making a range of assumptions on height across history that are and perhaps can never be verified. Simulation studies can help us here as they allow us to vary our assumptions and so verify their consequences. The aim of this research is to simulate the evolution of height in the Netherlands across the last two hundred years. Effects of the environment and the heritability of height will vary across time based on estimates from other studies. The strength of selection can be varied across men and women, as well as mating patterns that change the response to selection (e.g., assortative mating). By parametrising the model by observed heights across history, and by varying the strength of selection, we aim to get insight on plausible estimates of how much natural selection has contributed to the major increase in stature in the Netherlands. Only by using a combination of methods and insights from different disciplines, including biology, demography, and history are we potentially able to address how much of the increase in height is due natural selection and other causes."

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nThe fertility decline associated with economic development has been attributed to a host of interrelated causes including the rising costs of children with industrialization, and shifts in family structure. One hypothesis is that kin may impart more pro-natal information within their networks than non-kin, and that this effect may be exacerbated in networks with high kin-density where greater social conformity would be expected. In this study, we tested these ideas using large personal networks (25 associates of the respondent) collected from a sample of Dutch women (N = 706). Kin (parents) were perceived to exert slightly more social pressure to have children than non-kin, although dense networks were not associated with greater pressure. In contrast, women reported talking to friends about having children to a greater extent than kin, although greater kin-density in the network increased the likelihood of women reporting that they could talk to kin about having children. Both consanguineal and affinal kin could be asked to help with child-care to a greater extent than friends and other non-kin. Overall, there was mixed evidence that kin were more likely to offer pro-natal information than non-kin, and better evidence to suggest that kin were considered to be a better source of child-care support."

    "text": "Description\nEducation is a strong driver of whether and when women become mothers. Many different and contradicting mechanisms have been proposed to explain why highly educated women are more likely to remain childless and become mothers at higher ages than less educated women. The demands on data to disentangle these mechanisms are extraordinary, and no dataset exists that allows for this. Microsimulation models can help in this situation by explicitly modelling the mechanisms and comparing the outcomes of the models to real-world outcomes. The simulation models presented here simulate fertility outcomes over the life courses of agents based on behavioural factors, such preferences and partnership trajectories, and biological factors that determine the ability to have children, such as the age at sterility, fecundability, and intrauterine mortality. To parametrise the models, we use administrative data from Social Statistics Netherlands, survey data from the LISS panel for the behavioural factors, and findings from reproductive medicine for the biological parameters. Our models show that unintended childlessness strongly differs between women with different educational levels. Despite higher educated women preferring to have children at a later age, our simulations showed that these preferences hardly played a role in explaining childlessness. The higher age at cohabitation was the main explanation for the higher unintended childlessness among highly educated women. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of our simulation approach and how it can contribute to family sociology."

An understanding of humans would most certainly require an evolutionary perspective from such a stance. On the other hand, the remarkably cultural diversity observed in humans, combined with the apparent agency in decision-making, would suggest that such an evolutionary perspective is not essential. How to study humans evolutionary is therefore not straightforward, and indeed, there are several evolutionary approaches on offer in the study of human behaviour. In this talk, I’ll discuss the merits of these approaches, and apply them to reproductive behaviour in contemporary, industrialised populations."

Maar in welke mate we de evolutionaire biologie kunnen gebruiken om menselijk gedrag te duiden, daar zijn grote meningsverschillen over. Tijdens deze lezing, zet ik de diverse evolutionaire stromingen over menselijk gedrag uiteen en hoe deze doorgaans te werk gaan. Van de evolutionaire psychologie, waar het oeroude brein centraal staat, tot de gedragsecologie, dat zich vooral richt op wie de meeste kinderen krijgen, tot het culturele evolutionisme, waarin onze sterke neiging om van anderen te leren centraal staat. Deze wetenschappelijke perspectieven verschillen sterk in hun antwoord op belangrijke vragen als: evolueert de mens nog? Gedragen mensen in moderne maatschappijen zich nog adaptief? Hebben wij een oeroud brein? Hopelijk biedt de lezing de participant enige handvatten om met spraakmakende, evolutionair getinte nieuwsartikelen om te gaan (bijvoorbeeld: ‘vrouwen houden van winkelen vanwege evolutie’, of ‘het Paleodieet is het enige juiste dieet’)."

Different mechanisms of influence are distinguished, including social learning, pressure, contagion, and support. I’ll discuss to what extent these mechanisms can explain why there is such a strong positive association between education and being childfree. Data come from the LISS-panel, a representative, longitudinal internet panel in the Netherlands. Large personal networks (of 25 alters) were collected for ~750 Duch women. I’ll also highlight a new survey-tool that allows for a efficient and ‘fun’ way of collecting personal network data, typically a burdensome task."

Previous studies typically focused on the age at which people have their first child, but little is known about desired timing of parenthood and how this desire changes. In this study, we examined three facets of postponement: (1) desired age to have a first child, (2) changes in this desired age, and (3) whether the desires are met. We use data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (N = 2,296), which is a representative sample of men and women in the Netherlands who have been followed for up to ten years. Men and women desire to have children at relatively high ages, i.e., around age 30. About half of the respondents update these desires by increasing the desired age as they get older. Half of respondents do not become a parent at their desired time. The high ages at first birth observed are due to a combination of the three facets of postponement. This study contributes to the literature by showing that the high observed age at which people have children nowadays is due to high desired ages, updating these desires upwards, and not achieving their desired timing."

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nSocial influence has a prominent role in theories on fertility, implying that people’s reproductive decision-making is affected by the choices and behaviours of others. Multiple social influence mechanisms are thought to change people’s fertility behaviour, including social learning, social contagion, social capital, and social pressure. Comprehensively investigating these mechanisms of social influence in contemporary populations has been difficult, and most findings stem from convenience samples, qualitative studies, or studies focussing on single mechanisms. Here we examine the opportunity for social influence by these different mechanisms simultaneously using a unique representative sample of 706 Dutch women reporting on 17,650 social relations (obtained via the LISS panel). In particular, we investigated variation in the composition of the network in terms of fertility-relevant characteristics, including the number of childfree individuals in the personal network, the number of people with (young) children, and the number of people that can help you with child care. Characterising variation in these traits in personal networks gives unique insights into the opportunities for social influence. Follow-up studies will address how such variation shapes fertility behaviour."

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nDemography and sociology have produced a sophisticated body of work on fertility outcomes, i.e., whether, why, and when people have children. Such research has uncovered many characteristics underlying fertility. Unfortunately, traditional ways of statistical analyses means that results are difficult to compare across studies and that we have little understanding on the (relative) importance of these characteristics. In light of the credibility crisis that has taken hold of many other fields and disciplines, one might similarly worry about the robustness of findings in demography. In this talk I will argue that a focus on predictive ability and on microsimulation will advance fertility research and make it more reliable. In the first part of the talk, I will make a plea for reporting out-of-sample predictive ability. I argue that this form of predictive ability i) is the most relevant effect size we should be interested in, because it is a measure of how well our theories do in practice, ii) prevents overfitting and is less susceptible to researcher degrees of freedom, iii) facilitates comparison between theory and data-driven approaches, and iv) allows for prediction benchmarks which have facilitated cumulative knowledge in other disciplines. In the second part of the talk, I will discuss how microsimulation models of fertility can advance existing research. A simulation model that includes findings from reproductive medicine on the ability to have children (e.g., the age at sterility, fecundability) is developed to quantify to what extent higher levels of childlessness among highly educated Dutch women are explained by preferences and partnership trajectories. I conclude by arguing that a shift towards prediction in combination with theory-driven microsimulation models increases the robustness of findings and allows a unique perspective on the state of fertility research."

Further, we considered whether antonyms are key arguments in the inferences that license contrast. We looked at the frequency of both indirect and direct antonym pairs in contrastive sentences marked with but and sentences with antonym pairs without but. Antonyms and but co-occurred in only 1% of the 218,017 sentences studied. However, in 81% of but marked sentences with true antonyms pairs, the feature the antonyms described was a source of the contrast. In the non-but marked sentences, antonymy alone was a poor predictor, licensing a contrast in only 15% of the cases. We also found that direct antonyms are better predictors of contrast than indirect antonyms, and certain antonym pairs, like same-different, are consistently good predictors. These results could be used to find unmarked contrast relations with antonyms alone."

Yet, such claims are often based on an arbitrary selection of elections, and inadequate statistical analysis. Using data on all presidential elections, we show that height is indeed an important factor in the US presidential elections. Candidates that were taller than their opponents received more popular votes, although they were not significantly more likely to win the actual election. Taller presidents were also more likely to be reelected. In addition, presidents were, on average, much taller than men from the same birth cohort. The advantage of taller candidates is potentially explained by perceptions associated with height: taller presidents are rated by experts as ‘greater’, and having more leadership and communication skills. We conclude that height is an important characteristic in choosing and evaluating political leaders."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPrevious research has shown repeatedly that human stature influences mate preferences and mate choice in heterosexuals. In general, it has been shown that tall men and average height women are most preferred by the opposite sex, and that both sexes prefer to be in a relationship where the man is taller than the woman. However, little is known about such partner preferences in homosexual individuals. Based on an online survey of a large sample of non-heterosexual men (N = 541), we found that the majority of men prefer a partner slightly taller than themselves. However, these preferences were dependent on the participant’s own height, such that taller men preferred shorter partners, whereas shorter men preferred taller partners. We also examined whether height preferences predicted the preference for dominance and the adoption of particular sexual roles within a couple. Although a large proportion of men preferred to be in an egalitarian relationship with respect to preferred dominance (although not with respect to preferred sexual role), men that preferred a more dominant and more “active” sexual role preferred shorter partners, whereas those that preferred a more submissive and more “passive” sexual role preferred taller partners. Our results indicate that preferences for relative height in homosexual men are modulated by own height, preferred dominance and sex role, and do not simply resemble those of heterosexual women or men."

    "text": "Abstract\nContemporary humans occupy the widest range of socioeconomic environments in their evolutionary history, and this has revealed unprecedented environmentally-induced plasticity in physical growth. This plasticity also has limits, and identifying those limits can help researchers: (1) parse when population differences arise from environmental inputs or not and (2) determine when it is possible to infer socioeconomic disparities from disparities in body form. To illustrate potential limits to environmental plasticity, we analyze body mass index (BMI) and height data from 1,768,962 women and 207,341 men (20–49 y) living in households exhibiting 1000-fold variation in household wealth (51 countries, 1985–2017, 164 surveys) across four world regions—sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Latin America, and North Africa and the Middle East. We find that relationships of environmental inputs with both mean height and BMI bottom out at roughly 100–700 USD per capita household wealth (2011 international units, PPP), but at different basal BMIs and basal heights for different regions. The relationship with resources tops out for BMI at around 20K–35K USD for women, with growth potential due to environmental inputs in the range of 6.2–8.4kg/m2. By contrast, mean BMI for men and mean height for both sexes remains sensitive to environmental inputs even at levels far above the low- and middle-income samples studied here. This suggest that further work integrating comparable data from low- and high-income samples should provide a better picture of the full range of environmental inputs on human height and BMI. We conclude by discussing how neglecting such population-specific limits to human growth can lead to erroneous inferences about population differences."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe Dutch have a remarkable history when it comes to height. From being one of the shortest European populations in the 19th Century, the Dutch grew some 20 cm and are currently the tallest population in the world. Wealth, hygiene, and diet are well-established contributors to this major increase in height. Some have suggested that natural selection may also contribute to the trend, but evidence is weak. Here, we investigate the potential role of natural selection in the increase in height through simulations. We first ask what if natural selection was solely responsible for the observed increase in height? If the increase in average height was fully due to natural selection on male height, then across six consecutive generations, men who were two standard deviation above average height would need to have eight times more children on average. If selection acted only through those who have the opportunity to reproduce, then reproduction would need to be restricted to the tallest third (37%) of the population in order to give rise to the stark increase in height over time. No linear relationship between height and child mortality is able to account for the increase over time. We then present simulations based on previously observed estimates of partnership, mortality, selection and heritability and show that natural selection had a negligible effect (estimates from 0.07 to 0.36 cm) on the increase in height in the period 1850 to 2000. Our simulations highlight the plasticity of height and how remarkable the trend in height is in evolutionary terms. Only by using a combination of methods and insights from different disciplines, including biology, demography, and history are we potentially able to address how much of the increase in height is due to natural selection versus other causes."

    "text": "Abstract\nBiological, genetic, and socio-demographic factors are all important in explaining reproductive behavior, yet these factors are typically studied in isolation. In this study, we explore an innovative sociogenomic approach, which entails including key socio-demographic (marriage, education, occupation, religion, cohort) and genetic factors related to both behavioral [age at first birth (AFB), number of children ever born (NEB)] and biological fecundity-related outcomes (endometriosis, age at menopause and menarche, polycystic ovary syndrome, azoospermia, testicular dysgenesis syndrome) to explain childlessness. We examine the association of all sets of factors with childlessness as well as the interplay between them. We derive polygenic scores (PGS) from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and apply these in the Health and Retirement Study (N = 10,686) and Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (N = 8,284). Both socio-demographic and genetic factors were associated with childlessness. Whilst socio-demographic factors explain 19–46% in childlessness, the current PGS explains &lt;1% of the variance, and only PGSs from large GWASs are related to childlessness. Our findings also indicate that genetic and socio-demographic factors are not independent, with PGSs for AFB and NEB related to education and age at marriage. The explained variance by polygenic scores on childlessness is limited since it is largely a behavioral trait, with genetic explanations expected to increase somewhat in the future with better-powered GWASs. As genotyping of individuals in social science surveys becomes more prevalent, the method described in this study can be applied to other outcomes."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe lack of association between wealth and fertility in contemporary industrialized populations has often been used to question the value of an evolutionary perspective on human behaviour. Here, we first present the history of this debate, and the evolutionary explanations for why wealth and fertility (the number of children) are decoupled in modern industrial settings. We suggest that the nature of the relationship between wealth and fertility remains an open question because of the multi-faceted nature of wealth, and because existing cross-sectional studies are ambiguous with respect to how material wealth and fertility are linked. A literature review of longitudinal studies on wealth and fertility shows that the majority of these report positive effects of wealth, although levels of fertility seem to fall below those that would maximize fitness. We emphasize that reproductive decision-making reflects a complex interplay between individual and societal factors that resists simple evolutionary interpretation, and highlight the role of economic insecurity in fertility decisions. We conclude by discussing whether the wealth–fertility relationship can inform us about the adaptiveness of modern fertility behaviour, and argue against simplistic claims regarding maladaptive behaviour in humans."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nHeterosexual age preferences have been extensively studied by evolutionary psychologists, social psychologists, and demographers. Much less is known about such preferences in homosexual men and women. Around two decades ago, D. T. Kenrick, R. C. Keefe, A. Bryan, A. Barr, and S. Brown (1995) examined heterosexual and homosexual mating preferences for age in men and women. Our study aimed to replicate these findings by examining age preferences in a larger UK online dating sample. Dating advertisements of 996 male and female heterosexuals and homosexuals were coded. Age preferences were assessed via generalized linear models with robust standard errors and bootstrapping. Results showed that the relation between own age and preferred age differed substantially between the groups. With increasing age, heterosexual men preferred younger partners. Older heterosexual men (&gt; 50 years) exclusively sought (much) younger women than themselves, whereas younger heterosexual men sought both older and younger women. Male and female homosexuals followed this general trend of preferring increasingly younger mates with increasing age. However, they displayed a higher upper age tolerance and greater range of acceptable ages than both heterosexual men and women. Female heterosexuals’ age preferences were distinct from the other groups, in that they displayed a male older norm with no substantial interest expressed in males younger than themselves. Our findings thus largely corroborate those of Kenrick et al. with some exceptions, such as a larger tolerance of age ranges in homosexual men and women compared to heterosexual men and women. Results are discussed with reference to the current literature on similarities and differences in heterosexual and homosexual mate preferences."

However, some research suggests that large age gaps are actually more common with low male income, at least in the general population. Here, we examine spousal age differences among the super wealthy (Forbes 400 list – the richest 400 individuals in the US). Men from the Forbes 400 on average had a spouse who was seven years younger, which is significantly different from the mean age difference between spouses in the US population. Furthermore when these men remarried, their subsequent spouse was substantially younger, twenty-two years younger on average, again markedly different from the general population. Wealthy women did not differ from the general population in terms of spousal age differences. We conclude that based on these data the stereotype that rich men (re)marry younger wives holds a kernel of truth, at least for a sample of the super wealthy."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPurpose: The experience sampling method (ESM) is used for intensive longitudinal time-series data collection during normal daily life. ESM data give information on momentary affect, activities and (social) context of, for example, patients suffering from mental disorders, and allows for person-specific feedback reports. However, current personalized feedback reports only display a selection of measured variables, and typically involve only summary statistics, thus not reflecting the dynamic fluctuations in affect and its influencing factors. To address this shortcoming, we developed a tool for dynamically visualizing ESM data. Methods: We introduce a new framework, ESMvis, for giving descriptive feedback, focusing on direct visualization of the dynamic nature of raw data. In this ESM feedback approach, raw ESM data are visualized using R software. We applied ESMvis to data collected for over 52 weeks on a patient diagnosed with an obsessive–compulsive disorder with comorbid depression. Results: We provided personalized feedback, in which both the overall trajectory and specific time moments were captured in a movie format. Two relapses during the study period could be visually determined, and subsequently confirmed by the therapist. The therapist and patient evaluated ESMvis as an insightful add-on tool to care-as-usual. Conclusion: ESMvis is a showcase on providing personalized feedback by dynamic visualization of ESM time-series data. Our tool is freely available and adjustable, making it widely applicable. In addition to potential applications in clinical practice, ESMvis can work as an exploratory tool that can lead to new hypotheses and inform more complex statistical techniques."

    "text": "Abstract\nPersonal network data is increasingly used to answer research questions about the interplay between individuals (i.e., egos) and their social environment (i.e., alters). Researchers designing such data collections face a trade-off: When eliciting a high number of alters, study participation can be particularly burdensome as all data is obtained by surveying the ego. Eliciting a low number of alters, however, may incur bias in network characteristics. In the present study we use a sample of 701 Dutch women and their personal networks of 25 alters to investigate two strategies reducing respondent burden in personal network data collections: (1) eliciting fewer alters and (2) selecting a random subsample from the original set of elicited alters for full assessment. We present the amount of bias in structural and compositional network characteristics connected to applying these strategies for every possible network size (2–24 alters) as well as the potential study time savings as a proxy for respondent burden reduction. Our results can aid researchers designing a personal network study to balance respondent burden and bias in estimates for a range of compositional and structural network characteristics."

The status of the discipline, and its recent history, is far from straightforward, and debates among various schools of thought have been rather fraught at times. In what follows, we lay out the origins of Evolutionary Psychology, Human Behavioral Ecology and Gene-Culture Co-Evolutionary theory, explore their central tenets, and discuss the links between them. We also identify areas of tension, and discuss some of the criticisms advanced at these different approaches, both from within and outside the discipline. We emphasize the need for a more pluralist, biosocial stance in which cultural explanations are not considered distinct from biological ones, nor as complementary, but as fully intertwined."

Understanding this cross-study heterogeneity of reported preferred family size will contribute to the debates on the uncertainty of fertility in China. This paper quantified how much heterogeneity in aggregate-level fertility preferences can be explained by taking into account the demographic characteristics of the sample, its geographical location, and the measurement of fertility preferences. We retrieved 124 estimates of average preferred family size from 94 publications (from the year 2001 and onwards) in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI) and used mixed-effect meta-regression model to investigate heterogeneity. We found that the average preferred number of children in China since 2001 ranged from 0.91 to 2.88, with an average of 1.70 (SD = 0.26). Demographic differences accounted for 23%, human geographic regionalization for 21%, and the measurement of fertility preferences for 13% of the between-study variation. Sample characteristics (demographic and regional differences) and the measurement of fertility preferences together accounted for 46% of the variation in average preferred fertility. The averaged preferred family size varies by different characteristics and measurement. This study also points out whether particular groups have higher or lower preferences. It helps researchers to put estimates from fertility preferences from single studies in perspective. Moreover, this study can help resolve why researchers have such different outlooks on the future fertility of China."

The biology of telomeres dictates shortening with age, although telomere elongation with age has repeatedly been observed within a minority of individuals in several populations. These findings have been attributed to error, rather than actual telomere elongation, restricting our understanding of its possible biological significance. Here we present a method to distinguish between error and telomere elongation in longitudinal datasets, which is easy to apply and has few assumptions. Using simulations, we show that the method has considerable statistical power (&gt;80 %) to detect even a small proportion (6.7 %) of TL increases in the population, within a relatively small sample (N = 200), while maintaining the standard level of Type I error rate (α ≤ 0.05)."

Previous studies typically focused on the age at which people have their first child, but little is known about desired timing of parenthood and how this desire changes. Objective: In this study, we examined three facets of postponement: (1) desired age to have a first child, (2) changes in this desired age, and (3) whether the desires are met. Methods: We use data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (N = 2,296), which is a representative sample of men and women in the Netherlands who have been followed for up to ten years. Results: Men and women desire to have children at relatively high ages, i.e., around age 30. About half of the respondents update these desires by increasing the desired age as they get older. Half of respondents do not become a parent at their desired time. Conclusions: The high ages at first birth observed are due to a combination of the three facets of postponement. Contribution: This study contributes to the literature by showing that the high observed age at which people have children nowadays is due to high desired ages, updating these desires upwards, and not achieving their desired timing."

    "text": "Abstract\nResearch on genetic influences on human fertility outcomes such as number of children ever born (NEB) or the age at first childbirth (AFB) has been solely based on twin and family-designs that suffer from problematic assumptions and practical limitations. The current study exploits recent advances in the field of molecular genetics by applying the genomic-relationship-matrix based restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) methods to quantify for the first time the extent to which common genetic variants influence the NEB and the AFB of women. Using data from the UK and the Netherlands (N = 6,758), results show significant additive genetic effects on both traits explaining 10% (SE = 5) of the variance in the NEB and 15% (SE = 4) in the AFB. We further find a significant negative genetic correlation between AFB and NEB in the pooled sample of –0.62 (SE = 0.27, p-value = 0.02). This finding implies that individuals with genetic predispositions for an earlier AFB had a reproductive advantage and that natural selection operated not only in historical, but also in contemporary populations. The observed postponement in the AFB across the past century in Europe contrasts with these findings, suggesting an evolutionary override by environmental effects and underscoring that evolutionary predictions in modern human societies are not straight forward. It emphasizes the necessity for an integrative research design from the fields of genetics and social sciences in order to understand and predict fertility outcomes. Finally, our results suggest that we may be able to find genetic variants associated with human fertility when conducting GWAS-meta analyses with sufficient sample size."

Satisfaction with one’s own height and one’s partner height seem likely to be related to these preferences. Using a student sample (N = 650), we show that women are not only more selective, but also more consistent, than men, in their partner height preferences. Women prefer, on average, a larger height difference between themselves and their partner (i.e. males being much taller than themselves) than men do. This effect is even more pronounced when examining satisfaction with actual partner height: women are most satisfied when their partner was 21 cm taller, whereas men are most satisfied when they were 8 cm taller than their partner. Next, using data from our sample and that of a previously published study (N = 52,677), we show that for men, height is more important to the expression of satisfaction with one’s own height than it is for women. Furthermore, slightly above average height women and tall men are most satisfied with their heights. We conclude that satisfaction with one’s own height is at least partly a consequence of the height preference of the opposite sex and satisfaction with one’s partner height."

    "text": "Abstract\nIntralocus sexual conflict (IASC) occurs when a trait under selection in one sex constrains the other sex from achieving its sex-specific fitness optimum. Selection pressures on body size often differ between the sexes across many species, including humans: among men individuals of average height enjoy the highest reproductive success, while shorter women have the highest reproductive success. Given its high heritability, IASC over human height is likely. Using data from sibling pairs from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, we present evidence for IASC over height: in shorter sibling pairs (relatively) more reproductive success (number of children) was obtained through the sister than through the brother of the sibling pair. By contrast, in average height sibling pairs most reproductive success was obtained through the brother relative to the sister. In conclusion, we show that IASC over a heritable, sexually dimorphic physical trait (human height) affects Darwinian fitness in a contemporary human population."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Social interactions are important for well-being, and therefore, researchers are increasingly attempting to capture people’s social environment. Many different disciplines have developed tools to measure the social environment, which can be highly variable over time. The experience sampling method (ESM) is often used in psychology to study the dynamics within a person and the social environment. In addition, passive sensing is often used to capture social behavior via sensors from smartphones or other wearable devices. Furthermore, sociologists use egocentric networks to track how social relationships are changing. Each of these methods is likely to tap into different but important parts of people’s social environment. Thus far, the development and implementation of these methods have occurred mostly separately from each other. Objective: Our aim was to synthesize the literature on how these methods are currently used to capture the changing social environment in relation to well-being and assess how to best combine these methods to study well-being. Methods: We conducted a scoping review according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results: We included 275 studies. In total, 3 important points follow from our review. First, each method captures a different but important part of the social environment at a different temporal resolution. Second, measures are rarely validated (&gt;70% of ESM studies and 50% of passive sensing studies were not validated), which undermines the robustness of the conclusions drawn. Third, a combination of methods is currently lacking (only 15/275, 5.5% of the studies combined ESM and passive sensing, and no studies combined all 3 methods) but is essential in understanding well-being. Conclusions: We highlight that the practice of using poorly validated measures hampers progress in understanding the relationship between the changing social environment and well-being. We conclude that different methods should be combined more often to reduce the participants’ burden and form a holistic perspective on the social environment."

We made use of GENSI, a recently developed tool for network data collection using interactive visual elements that has been shown to reduce respondent burden. A sample of 758 women between the ages of 18 and 40 were recruited through the LISS-panel; a longitudinal online survey of Dutch people. Respondents were asked to name exactly 25 alters, answer sixteen questions about these alters (name interpreter questions), and assess all 300 alter-alter relations. Nearly all (97%) respondents reported on 25 alters. Non-response was minimal: 92% of respondents had no missing values, and an additional 5% had fewer than 10% missing values. Listing 25 alters took 3.5 ± 2.2 (mean ± SD) minutes, and reporting on the ties between these alters took 3.6 ± 1.3 min. Answering all alter questions took longest with a time of 15.2 ± 5.3 min. The majority of respondents thought the questions were clear and easy to answer, and most enjoyed filling in the survey. Collecting large personal networks can mean a significant burden to respondents, but through the use of visual elements in the survey, it is clear that it can be done within reasonable time, with enjoyment and without much non-response."

Male and female police officers were taller than the average population. A larger percentage of women than of men was found in the lowest ranks, but in the leadership positions, there was a similar percentage of women as of men. Overall, but especially among women, height was linearly associated with occupational rank: the taller one was, the higher one’s rank. These effects were independent of educational level and age. The implications for evolutionary theorizing from the perspective of sexual selection on the effect of tallness on status and dominance among women are discussed."

    "text": "Abstract\nWestern scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) engage in a variety of cache-protection strategies to reduce the chances of cache theft by conspeci- fics. Many of these strategies revolve around reducing visual information to potential thieves. This study aimed to determine whether the jays also reduce auditory information during caching. Each jay was given the opportunity to cache food in two trays, one of which was filled with small pebbles that made considerable noise when cached in (‘noisy’ tray), whereas the other one contained soil that made little detectable noise when cached in (‘quiet’ tray). When the jays could be heard, but not seen, by a competitor, they cached proportionally less food items in the ‘noisy’ substrate than when they cached alone in the room, or when they could be seen and heard by competitors. These results suggest that western scrub-jays know when to conceal auditory information, namely when a competitor cannot see but can hear the caching event."

    "text": "Abstract\nMutual mate choice is prevalent in humans, where both males and females have a say in their choice of partner. How the choices made by one sex constrain the choice of the other remains poorly understood, however, because human studies have mostly limited themselves to measuring preferences. We used a sample of 5782 speed-daters making 128104 choices to link preferences for partner height to actual choice and the formation of a match (the mutual expression of interest to meet again). We show that sexual conflict at the level of preferences is translated into choice: women were most likely to choose a speed-dater 25 cm taller than themselves, whereas men were most likely to choose women only 7 cm shorter than themselves. As a consequence, matches were most likely at an intermediate height difference (19 cm) that differed significantly from the preferred height difference of both sexes. Thus, our study reveals how mutual mate choice can result in suboptimal pair formation for both sexes, highlighting the importance of assessing the mate choice process in its entirety."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe Dutch are the tallest people on earth. Over the last 200 years, they have grown 20 cm in height: a rapid rate of increase that points to environmental causes. This secular trend in height is echoed across allWestern populations, but came to an end, or at least levelled off, much earlier than in The Netherlands. One possibility, then, is that natural selection acted congruently with these environmentally induced changes to further promote tall stature among the people of the lowlands. Using data from the LifeLines study, which follows a large sample of the population of the north of The Netherlands (n = 94 516), we examined how height was related to measures of reproductive success (as a proxy for fitness). Across three decades (1935–1967), height was consistently related to reproductive output (number of children born and number of surviving children), favouring taller men and average height women. This was despite a later age at first birth for taller individuals. Furthermore, even in this low-mortality population, taller women experienced higher child survival, which contributed positively to their increased reproductive success. Thus,natural selection in addition to good environmental conditions may help explain why the Dutch are so tall."

The present research describes sex differences in patterns of risk taking in day-to-day behavior among Dutch cyclists. Through three observational studies we test sex differences in risk taking in situations of financial risk (fines for failing to use bike lights, Study 1), theft risk (bike locking behavior, Study 2) as well as physical risk (risky maneuvers, Study 3). Results corroborate previous findings by showing that across these domains men are more inclined to take risks than women. We discuss how these findings might be used in an applied context."

We hypothesize that this is because the advantages associated with taller stature accrue mainly from not being short, rather than from being taller than average. Lower fertility by short men may be a consequence of their and their partner’s lower scores on aspects of mate quality. Taller men, although they score higher on mate quality compared to average height men, may have lower fertility because they are more likely to be paired with taller women, who are potentially less fertile. Methods: We analyzed data from The Integrated Health Interview Series (IHIS) of the United States (N = 165,606). Segmented regression was used to examine patterns across the height continuum. Results: On all aspects of own and partner quality, shorter men scored lower than both average height and taller men. Height more strongly predicted these aspects when moving from short to average height, than when moving from average to taller heights. Women of a given height who scored lower on mate quality also had shorter partners. Conclusions: Shorter men faced a double disadvantage with respect to both their own mate quality and that of their spouses. Scores of taller men were only marginally higher than those of average height men, suggesting that being tall is less important than not being short. Although effect sizes were small, our results may partly explain why shorter and taller men have lower fertility than those of average stature."

During one season, a talented tennis player filled out an online diary questionnaire twice a week. We visualized the results using R-scripts that we made openly available.

Methods: We used data from a long‐term study of 5,326 female Wisconsin high school graduates to examine the association between female height and reproductive success. Twenty‐one samples on this association were covered by our literature review. Results: Shorter women had more children surviving to age 18 than taller women, despite increased child mortality in shorter women. Taller women had a higher age at first birth and age at first marriage and reached a higher social status, but the negative effect of height on reproductive success persisted after controlling for these variables. However, while these effects were quite consistent in Western populations, they were not consistently present in non‐Western populations. Our review also indicated that child mortality was almost universally higher among shorter women. Conclusions: We conclude that shorter women have a higher number of live births but that final reproductive success depends on the positive effect of height on child survival."

Although we know much about human height, this information has rarely been brought together in a comprehensive, systematic fashion. Here, we present a synthetic review of the literature on human height from an explicit evolutionary perspective, addressing its phylogenetic history, development, and environmental and genetic influences on growth and stature. In addition to presenting evidence to suggest the past action of natural selection on human height, we also assess the evidence that natural and sexual selection continues to act on height in contemporary populations. Although there is clear evidence to suggest that selection acts on height, mainly through life‐history processes but perhaps also directly, it is also apparent that methodological factors reduce the confidence with which such inferences can be drawn, and there remain surprising gaps in our knowledge. The inability to draw firm conclusions about the adaptiveness of such a highly visible and easily measured trait suggests we should show an appropriate degree of caution when dealing with other human traits in evolutionary perspective."

    "text": "Abstract\nDoes evolutionary theorizing have a role in psychology? This is a more contentious issue than one might imagine, given that, as evolved creatures, the answer must surely be yes. The contested nature of evolutionary psychology lies not in our status as evolved beings, but in the extent to which evolutionary ideas add value to studies of human behavior, and the rigor with which these ideas are tested. This, in turn, is linked to the framework in which particular evolutionary ideas are situated. While the framing of the current research topic places the brain-as-computer metaphor in opposition to evolutionary psychology, the most prominent school of thought in this field (born out of cognitive psychology, and often known as the Santa Barbara school) is entirely wedded to the computational theory of mind as an explanatory framework. Its unique aspect is to argue that the mind consists of a large number of functionally specialized (i.e., domain-specific) computational mechanisms, or modules (the massive modularity hypothesis). Far from offering an alternative to, or an improvement on, the current perspective, we argue that evolutionary psychology is a mainstream computational theory, and that its arguments for domain-specificity often rest on shaky premises. We then go on to suggest that the various forms of e-cognition (i.e., embodied, embedded, enactive) represent a true alternative to standard computational approaches, with an emphasis on “cognitive integration” or the “extended mind hypothesis” in particular. We feel this offers the most promise for human psychology because it incorporates the social and historical processes that are crucial to human “mind-making” within an evolutionarily informed framework. In addition to linking to other research areas in psychology, this approach is more likely to form productive links to other disciplines within the social sciences, not least by encouraging a healthy pluralism in approach."

    "text": "Abstract\nTheoretical analyses and empirical studies have revealed that conflict escalation is more likely when individuals are more similar in resource-holding potential (RHP). Conflicts can also occur between groups, but it is unknown whether conflicts also escalate more when groups are more similar in RHP. We tested this hypothesis in humans, using data from two professional sports competitions: football (the Bundesliga, the German first division of football) and basketball (the NBA, the North American National Basketball Association). We defined RHP based on the league ranks of the teams involved in the competition (i.e. their competitive ability) and measured conflict escalation by the number of fouls committed. We found that in both sports the number of fouls committed increased when the difference in RHP was smaller. Thus, we provide what is to our best knowledge the first evidence that, as in conflicts between individuals, conflicts escalate more when groups are more similar in RHP."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIs fertility relevant to evolutionary analyses conducted in modern industrial societies? This question has been the subject of a highly contentious debate, beginning in the late 1980s and continuing to this day. Researchers in both evolutionary and social sciences have argued that the measurement of fitness-related traits (e.g., fertility) offers little insight into evolutionary processes, on the grounds that modern industrial environments differ so greatly from those of our ancestral past that our behavior can no longer be expected to be adaptive. In contrast, we argue that fertility measurements in industrial society are essential for a complete evolutionary analysis: in particular, such data can provide evidence for any putative adaptive mismatch between ancestral environments and those of the present day, and they can provide insight into the selection pressures currently operating on contemporary populations. Having made this positive case, we then go on to discuss some challenges of fertility-related analyses among industrialized populations, particularly those that involve large-scale databases. These include ‘researcher degrees of freedom’ (i.e., the choices made about which variables to analyze and how) and the different biases that may exist in such data. Despite these concerns, large datasets from multiple populations represent an excellent opportunity to test evolutionary hypotheses in great detail, enriching the evolutionary understanding of human behavior."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThere is continuing debate on how low China’s fertility has reached and whether China has fallen into the “low fertility trap”. This paper addresses this debate by revisiting the trends in fertility preferences in the past decades in China based on a meta review. Moreover, the analysis contrasts distinct measurements of fertility preferences to capture different aspects of reproductive decision-making. This papers reviews 152 studies resulting in 137 estimates for the mean of preferred number of children, 104 estimates for the proportions of different numbers of children preferred and 66 estimates for the second-child preferences. We found that after the long-time decline of fertility preferences in the last century, the average family size remained at a low level but started to increase slowly since 2001. This upturn was observed for all three types of measurements of fertility preferences: ideal, desired, and planned family size. The results also indicate a strong two-child preference (more than 50% of respondents) in China, although 30% of people prefer one child and only a small fraction indicating an ideal family size for three or more children. Results on people’s preference for a second child were less consistent. We concluded that fertility is unlikely to increase rapidly in China even when the government adopts more relaxed family planning policy. Because the upward trend in fertility preferences was very minimal and the economic constraints will prevent many people to realise their preferences."

    "text": "Abstract\nMeta-analyses of genome-wide association studies, which dominate genetic discovery, are based on data from diverse historical time periods and populations. Genetic scores derived from genome-wide association studies explain only a fraction of the heritability estimates obtained from whole-genome studies on single populations, known as the ‘hidden heritability’ puzzle. Using seven sampling populations (n = 35,062), we test whether hidden heritability is attributed to heterogeneity across sampling populations and time, showing that estimates are substantially smaller across populations compared with within populations. We show that the hidden heritability varies substantially: from zero for height to 20% for body mass index, 37% for education, 40% for age at first birth and up to 75% for number of children. Simulations demonstrate that our results are more likely to reflect heterogeneity in phenotypic measurement or gene–environment interactions than genetic heterogeneity. These findings have substantial implications for genetic discovery, suggesting that large homogenous datasets are required for behavioural phenotypes and that gene–environment interaction may be a central challenge for genetic discovery."

With a unique quantitative test of such differences based on 17,650 social relations of 706 Dutch women (aged 18–41), of whom 40% were considered friends, we examined (a) which kind of personal relations were typically identified as friends (e.g., family, colleague), (b) how this linked to relationship closeness, face-to-face and non-face-to-face contact, and (c) whether these relationship characteristics of friendships differed with age. Most friends were met at school (&gt;70%) and 20% of family were considered friends. Friendships were often close relationships with more non-face-to-face contact, while meeting in person was less predictive. Relatively older women reported fewer friends. Even in this homogenous sample with multiple measures of tie strength, friendships were difficult to predict and often overlapped with other social roles, meaning that researchers should be careful in using friendship as distinct category."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nMore than 30% of all pregnancies in the UK require some form of assistance at delivery, with one of the more severe forms of assistance being an emergency Caesarean section (ECS). Previously it has been shown that the likelihood of a delivery via ECS is positively associated with the birth weight and size of the newborn and negatively with maternal height. Paternal height affects skeletal growth and mass of the fetus, and thus might also affect pregnancy outcomes. We hypothesized that the effect of newborn birth weight on the risk of ECS would decrease with increasing maternal height. Similarly, we predicted that there would be an increase in ECS risk as a function of paternal height, but that this effect would be relative to maternal height (i.e., parental height differences). We used data from the Millennium Cohort Study: a large-scale survey (N = 18,819 births) with data on babies born and their parents from the United Kingdom surveyed 9 to 12-months after birth. We found that in primiparous women, both maternal height and parental height differences interacted with birth weight and predicted the likelihood of an ECS. When carrying a heavy newborn, the risk of ECS was more than doubled for short women (46.3%) compared to tall women (21.7%), in agreement with earlier findings. For women of average height carrying a heavy newborn while having a relatively short compared to tall partner reduced the risk by 6.7%. In conclusion, the size of the baby, the height of the mother and parental height differences affect the likelihood of an ECS in primiparous women."

We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth in the United States (N=4,198 women) and apply both logistic regression models to examine the role of childlessness desires early in life, and multilevel models for repeated measures to examine the role of childlessness expectations throughout the life course. We find that higher educational attainment and LFP are positively associated with childlessness. We do not find, however, that higher educated and working women more often desire or expect to remain childless. In contrast, we find that among women who ultimately remain childless, those women who work fulltime and have higher status occupations have higher expectations to have children throughout their life course. These results suggest that education and occupation produce constraints, resulting in the postponement of childbearing which hinders women in realizing their desires and expectations. Since many working women remain childless despite the desire and expectation to become a mother, our findings stress the importance of work-life reconciliation. It furthermore highlights the importance of increasing public awareness regarding the decrease in fecundity with age."

A typical finding in Western societies is that women prefer men who are taller than themselves and, equivalently, men prefer women who are shorter than themselves. However, recent reports in non-Western societies (e.g., the Himba in Namibia) challenge the view on the universality of such preferences. Here we report on male and female height preferences in two non-Western populations—the Hadza (Tanzania) and the Tsimane’ (Bolivia)—and the relationships between body height preferences and the height of actual partners. In the Hadza, most individuals preferred a sexual dimorphism in stature (SDS) with the man being much taller than the woman. Preferences for SDS and actual partner SDS were positively and significantly correlated in both men and women, suggesting that people who preferred larger height differences also had larger height differences with their partners. In the Tsimane’, the majority of men preferred an SDS with the man being taller than the woman, but women did not show such a preference. Unlike in the Hadza, SDS preference was not significantly correlated to actual partner SDS. We conclude that patterns of height preferences and choices in the Hadza and Tsimane’ are different than those observed in Western societies, and discuss possible causes for the observed differences between non-Western and Western societies."

Contemporary English language is also riddled with phrases that highlight an association between size and status (or the lack of it)—“a man of stature”, ‘standing tall’, ‘he was belittled’—and the phrase ‘high status’ itself incorporates a vertical dimension. This conflation of size and status across many different language groups and cultures has a rather straightforward explanation: on average, those in position of power or high in status, tend to be taller and bigger than those who are not. Positive associations between size and status have been observed in all kinds of cultural groupings, from hunter-gatherer groups to agricultural populations to industrialised societies (B. J.

Whereas females were consistently more intrasexually competitive the higher the socio-economic status of their parents, males with parents of the lowest socio-economic status tended to be more intrasexually competitive than those with parents of medium socio-economic status, and nearly as intrasexually competitive as those with parents of high socio-economic status. Only among adolescents with parents of low socio-economic status were males more intrasexually competitive than females. Among males and females, higher levels of intrasexual competitiveness were related to a higher family income, to a higher occupational status of the father as well as of the mother, and to a higher educational level of the mother. Only among females were higher levels of intrasexual competitiveness associated with a higher educational level of the father. Males whose fathers had only elementary education had a relatively high level of intrasexual competitiveness. The results are discussed in the context of the multifaceted nature of human status, and the potential relevance of intrasexual competitiveness for individuals of high versus low social status."

    "text": "Abstract\nFertility intentions as verbalized in surveys are a poor predictor of actual fertility outcomes, the number of children people have. This can partly be explained by the uncertainty people have in their intentions. Such uncertainties are hard to capture through traditional survey questions, although open-ended questions can be used to get insight into people’s subjective narratives of the future that determine their intentions. An- alyzing such answers to open-ended questions can be done through Natural Language Process- ing techniques. Traditional topic models (e.g., LSA and LDA), however, often fail to do since they rely on co-occurrences, which are often rare in short survey responses. The aim of this study was to apply and evaluate topic models on demographic survey data. In this study, we applied neural topic models (e.g. BERTopic, CombinedTM) based on language models to responses from Dutch women on their fertil- ity plans, and compared the topics and their coherence scores from each model to expert judgments. Our results show that neural mod- els produce topics more in line with human interpretation compared to LDA. However, the coherence score could only partly reflect on this, depending on the method and corpus used for calculation. This research is important be- cause, first, it helps us develop more informed strategies on model selection and evaluation for topic modeling on survey data; and second, it shows that the field of demography has much to gain from adopting novel NLP methods."

    "text": "Abstract\nPair formation, acquiring a mate to form a reproductive unit, is a complex process. Mating preferences are a step in this process. However, due to constraining factors such as availability of mates, rival competition, and mutual mate choice, preferred characteristics may not be realised in the actual partner. People value height in their partner and we investigated to what extent preferences for height are realised in actual couples. We used data from the Millennium Cohort Study (UK) and compared the distribution of height difference in actual couples to simulations of random mating to test how established mate preferences map on to actual mating patterns. In line with mate preferences, we found evidence for: (i) assortative mating (r = .18), (ii) the male-taller norm, and, for the first time, (iii) for the male-not-too-tall norm. Couples where the male partner was shorter, or over 25 cm taller than the female partner, occurred at lower frequency in actual couples than expected by chance, but the magnitude of these effects was modest. We also investigated another preference rule, namely that short women (and tall men) prefer large height differences with their partner, whereas tall women (and short men) prefer small height differences. These patterns were also observed in our population, although the strengths of these associations were weaker than previously reported strength of preferences. We conclude that while preferences for partner height generally translate into actual pairing, they do so only modestly."

    "text": "Abstract\nMedia reports often emphasize how the height of US presidential candidates plays an important role in election outcomes, with taller candidates winning an overwhelming number of elections across time. These claims are, however, rarely backed up by any form of reliable statistical analysis. Even when statistical methods are employed, they are often inadequate to the task. This case study discusses how to analyse presidential candidate height in relation to election success, showing how to calculate probabilities by hand, how to conduct a binomial test and how to perform randomization tests."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nStudies of the association between wealth and fertility in industrial populations have a rich history in the evolutionary literature, and they have been used to argue both for and against a behavioral ecological approach to explaining human variability. We consider that there are strong arguments in favor of measuring fertility (and proxies thereof) in industrial populations, not least because of the wide availability of large-scale secondary databases. Such data sources bring challenges as well as advantages, however. The purpose of this article is to illustrate these by examining the association between wealth and reproductive success in the United States, using the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979. We conduct a broad-based exploratory analysis of the relationship between wealth and fertility, employing both cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches, and multiple measures of both wealth (income and net worth) and fertility (lifetime reproductive success and transitions to first, second and third births). We highlight the kinds of decisions that have to be made regarding sample selection, along with the selection and construction of explanatory variables and control measures. Based on our analyses, we find a positive effect of both income and net worth on fertility for men, which is more pronounced for white men and for transitions to first and second births. Income tends to have a negative effect on fertility for women, while net worth is more likely to positively predict fertility. Different reproductive strategies among different groups within the same population highlight the complexity of the reproductive ecology of industrial societies. These results differ in a number of respects from other analyses using the same database. We suggest this reflects the impossibility of producing a definitive analysis, rather than a failure to identify the ‘correct’ analytical strategy. Finally, we discuss how these findings inform us about (mal)adaptive decision-making."

    "text": "Abstract\nGiven the heritability of human left-handedness and its purported associations with fitness-lowering traits, the persistence of the minority of left-handedness in human populations is an evolutionary puzzle. The fighting hypothesis proposes that these negative fitness costs are offset by fitness gains for left-handers when involved in fights with right-handers, as being a minority would generate a surprise effect increasing the chance of winning. The finding that left-handers are overrepresented in many combat sports is interpreted as evidence for this hypothesis. However, few studies have examined sports that show good similarity with realistic fights and analysed winning chances in relation to handedness of both fighters. We examined both, in a sample of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a fierce fighting sport hardly constrained by rules. Left-handers were strongly overrepresented as compared to the general male population but no advantage for left-handers when facing right-handers was found, providing only partial evidence for the fighting hypothesis."

    "text": "Abstract\nObjectives: The study of assortative mating for height has a rich history in human biology. Although the positive correlation between the stature of spouses has often been noted in western populations, recent papers suggest that mating patterns for stature are not universal. The objective of this paper was to review the published evidence to examine the strength of and universality in assortative mating for height. Methods: We conducted an extensive literature review and meta‐analysis. We started with published reviews but also searched through secondary databases. Our search led to 154 correlations of height between partners. We classified the populations as western and non‐western based on geography. These correlations were then analyzed via meta‐analytic techniques. Results: 148 of the correlations for partner heights were positive and the overall analysis indicates moderate positive assortative mating (r = .23). Although assortative mating was slightly stronger in countries that can be described as western compared to non‐western, this difference was not statistically significant. We found no evidence for a change in assortative mating for height over time. There was substantial residual heterogeneity in effect sizes and this heterogeneity was most pronounced in western countries. Conclusions: Positive assortative mating for height exists in human populations, but is modest in magnitude suggesting that height is not a major factor in mate choice. Future research is necessary to understand the underlying causes of the large amount of heterogeneity observed in the degree of assortative mating across human populations, which may stem from a combination of methodological and ecological differences."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe fertility decline associated with economic development has been attributed to a host of interrelated causes including the rising costs of children with industrialization, and shifts in family structure. One hypothesis is that kin may impart more pro-natal information within their networks than non-kin, and that this effect may be exacerbated in networks with high kin-density where greater social conformity would be expected. In this study, we tested these ideas using large personal networks (25 associates of the respondent) collected from a sample of Dutch women (N = 706). Kin (parents) were perceived to exert slightly more social pressure to have children than non-kin, although dense networks were not associated with greater pressure. In contrast, women reported talking to friends about having children to a greater extent than kin, although greater kin-density in the network increased the likelihood of women reporting that they could talk to kin about having children. Both consanguineal and affinal kin could be asked to help with child-care to a greater extent than friends and other non-kin. Overall, there was mixed evidence that kin were more likely to offer pro-natal information than non-kin, and better evidence to suggest that kin were considered to be a better source of child-care support."

We tested whether facial width was systematically related to cause of death in a forensic sample. We hypothesized that wider-faced males, being more aggressive and robust, would be less likely than narrower-faced males to die from contact violence (stabbed, strangled, or bludgeoned to death) compared with other forms of homicide. We tested this hypothesis in a forensic data sample covering 523 male and 339 female skeletons. In these data, men with narrower faces were more likely to have died as a consequence of homicides involving direct physical contact than men with wider faces. No such effect was found for women. This effect was found when considering all causes of mortality and when limiting the sample to homicides. This finding suggests that wider-faced males are less likely to die from male–male physical violence, perhaps because of their formidability. Our findings are discussed with reference to the previous literature indicating that facial width-to-height ratio is a marker for male dominance."

    "text": "Abstract\nAcross cultures, taller stature is linked to increased social status, but the potential reasons why this should be are unclear. One potential explanation is that taller individuals are more likely to win a dyadic confrontation with a competitor (i.e., they are more dominant), which leads to higher social rank. Although some previous studies have shown that perceptions of status or dominance are related to height, and are therefore consistent with such an explanation, there is surprisingly little research testing whether height actually has any influence on the behavioural outcomes in real-life social interactions. Here, we present three naturalistic observational studies demonstrating that height predicts interpersonal dominance during brief dyadic interactions. Study 1 investigated the likelihood of giving way in a narrow passage (N = 92); Study 2 investigated giving way in a busy shopping street, plus the likelihood of colliding with another individual (N = 1,108); and Study 3 investigated the likelihood of maintaining a linear path while walking, and potentially entering another individual’s personal space (N = 1,056). We conclude that human height is positively related to interpersonal dominance, and may well contribute to the widely observed positive association between height and social status."

    "text": "Abstract\nField data often include multiple observations taken from the same individual. In order to avoid pseudoreplication, it is commonplace to aggregate data, generating a mean score per individual, and then using these aggregated data in subsequent analyses. Aggregation, however, can generate problems of its own. Not only does it lead to a loss of information, it can also leave analyses vulnerable to the “ecological fallacy”: the drawing of false inferences about individual behavior on the basis of population level (“ecological”) data. It can also result in Simpson’s paradox, where relationships seen at the individual level can be completely reversed when analyzed at the aggregate level. These phenomena have been documented widely in the medical and social sciences but tend to go unremarked in primatological studies that rely on observational data from the field. Here, we provide a conceptual guide that explains how and why aggregate data are vulnerable to the ecological fallacy and Simpson’s paradox, illustrating these points using data on baboons. We then discuss one particular analytical approach, namely multi‐level modeling, that can potentially eliminate these problems. By highlighting the issue of the ecological fallacy, and increasing awareness of how datasets are often organized into a number of different levels, we also highlight the manner in which researchers can more positively exploit the structure of their datasets, without any information loss. These analytical approaches may thus provide greater insight into behavior by permitting more thorough investigation of interactions and cross‐level effects."

In general, it has been shown that tall men and average height women are most preferred by the opposite sex, and that both sexes prefer to be in a relationship where the man is taller than the woman. However, little is known about such partner preferences in homosexual individuals. Based on an online survey of a large sample of non-heterosexual men (N = 541), we found that the majority of men prefer a partner slightly taller than themselves. However, these preferences were dependent on the participant’s own height, such that taller men preferred shorter partners, whereas shorter men preferred taller partners. We also examined whether height preferences predicted the preference for dominance and the adoption of particular sexual roles within a couple. Although a large proportion of men preferred to be in an egalitarian relationship with respect to preferred dominance (although not with respect to preferred sexual role), men that preferred a more dominant and more “active” sexual role preferred shorter partners, whereas those that preferred a more submissive and more “passive” sexual role preferred taller partners. Our results indicate that preferences for relative height in homosexual men are modulated by own height, preferred dominance and sex role, and do not simply resemble those of heterosexual women or men."

    "text": "Abstract\nContemporary humans occupy the widest range of socioeconomic environments in their evolutionary history, and this has revealed unprecedented environmentally-induced plasticity in physical growth. This plasticity also has limits, and identifying those limits can help researchers: (1) parse when population differences arise from environmental inputs or not and (2) determine when it is possible to infer socioeconomic disparities from disparities in body form. To illustrate potential limits to environmental plasticity, we analyze body mass index (BMI) and height data from 1,768,962 women and 207,341 men (20–49 y) living in households exhibiting 1000-fold variation in household wealth (51 countries, 1985–2017, 164 surveys) across four world regions—sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Latin America, and North Africa and the Middle East. We find that relationships of environmental inputs with both mean height and BMI bottom out at roughly 100–700 USD per capita household wealth (2011 international units, PPP), but at different basal BMIs and basal heights for different regions. The relationship with resources tops out for BMI at around 20K–35K USD for women, with growth potential due to environmental inputs in the range of 6.2–8.4kg/m2. By contrast, mean BMI for men and mean height for both sexes remains sensitive to environmental inputs even at levels far above the low- and middle-income samples studied here. This suggest that further work integrating comparable data from low- and high-income samples should provide a better picture of the full range of environmental inputs on human height and BMI. We conclude by discussing how neglecting such population-specific limits to human growth can lead to erroneous inferences about population differences."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe Dutch have a remarkable history when it comes to height. From being one of the shortest European populations in the 19th Century, the Dutch grew some 20 cm and are currently the tallest population in the world. Wealth, hygiene, and diet are well-established contributors to this major increase in height. Some have suggested that natural selection may also contribute to the trend, but evidence is weak. Here, we investigate the potential role of natural selection in the increase in height through simulations. We first ask what if natural selection was solely responsible for the observed increase in height? If the increase in average height was fully due to natural selection on male height, then across six consecutive generations, men who were two standard deviation above average height would need to have eight times more children on average. If selection acted only through those who have the opportunity to reproduce, then reproduction would need to be restricted to the tallest third (37%) of the population in order to give rise to the stark increase in height over time. No linear relationship between height and child mortality is able to account for the increase over time. We then present simulations based on previously observed estimates of partnership, mortality, selection and heritability and show that natural selection had a negligible effect (estimates from 0.07 to 0.36 cm) on the increase in height in the period 1850 to 2000. Our simulations highlight the plasticity of height and how remarkable the trend in height is in evolutionary terms. Only by using a combination of methods and insights from different disciplines, including biology, demography, and history are we potentially able to address how much of the increase in height is due to natural selection versus other causes."

    "text": "Abstract\nBiological, genetic, and socio-demographic factors are all important in explaining reproductive behavior, yet these factors are typically studied in isolation. In this study, we explore an innovative sociogenomic approach, which entails including key socio-demographic (marriage, education, occupation, religion, cohort) and genetic factors related to both behavioral [age at first birth (AFB), number of children ever born (NEB)] and biological fecundity-related outcomes (endometriosis, age at menopause and menarche, polycystic ovary syndrome, azoospermia, testicular dysgenesis syndrome) to explain childlessness. We examine the association of all sets of factors with childlessness as well as the interplay between them. We derive polygenic scores (PGS) from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and apply these in the Health and Retirement Study (N = 10,686) and Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (N = 8,284). Both socio-demographic and genetic factors were associated with childlessness. Whilst socio-demographic factors explain 19–46% in childlessness, the current PGS explains &lt;1% of the variance, and only PGSs from large GWASs are related to childlessness. Our findings also indicate that genetic and socio-demographic factors are not independent, with PGSs for AFB and NEB related to education and age at marriage. The explained variance by polygenic scores on childlessness is limited since it is largely a behavioral trait, with genetic explanations expected to increase somewhat in the future with better-powered GWASs. As genotyping of individuals in social science surveys becomes more prevalent, the method described in this study can be applied to other outcomes."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe lack of association between wealth and fertility in contemporary industrialized populations has often been used to question the value of an evolutionary perspective on human behaviour. Here, we first present the history of this debate, and the evolutionary explanations for why wealth and fertility (the number of children) are decoupled in modern industrial settings. We suggest that the nature of the relationship between wealth and fertility remains an open question because of the multi-faceted nature of wealth, and because existing cross-sectional studies are ambiguous with respect to how material wealth and fertility are linked. A literature review of longitudinal studies on wealth and fertility shows that the majority of these report positive effects of wealth, although levels of fertility seem to fall below those that would maximize fitness. We emphasize that reproductive decision-making reflects a complex interplay between individual and societal factors that resists simple evolutionary interpretation, and highlight the role of economic insecurity in fertility decisions. We conclude by discussing whether the wealth–fertility relationship can inform us about the adaptiveness of modern fertility behaviour, and argue against simplistic claims regarding maladaptive behaviour in humans."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nHeterosexual age preferences have been extensively studied by evolutionary psychologists, social psychologists, and demographers. Much less is known about such preferences in homosexual men and women. Around two decades ago, D. T. Kenrick, R. C. Keefe, A. Bryan, A. Barr, and S. Brown (1995) examined heterosexual and homosexual mating preferences for age in men and women. Our study aimed to replicate these findings by examining age preferences in a larger UK online dating sample. Dating advertisements of 996 male and female heterosexuals and homosexuals were coded. Age preferences were assessed via generalized linear models with robust standard errors and bootstrapping. Results showed that the relation between own age and preferred age differed substantially between the groups. With increasing age, heterosexual men preferred younger partners. Older heterosexual men (&gt; 50 years) exclusively sought (much) younger women than themselves, whereas younger heterosexual men sought both older and younger women. Male and female homosexuals followed this general trend of preferring increasingly younger mates with increasing age. However, they displayed a higher upper age tolerance and greater range of acceptable ages than both heterosexual men and women. Female heterosexuals’ age preferences were distinct from the other groups, in that they displayed a male older norm with no substantial interest expressed in males younger than themselves. Our findings thus largely corroborate those of Kenrick et al. with some exceptions, such as a larger tolerance of age ranges in homosexual men and women compared to heterosexual men and women. Results are discussed with reference to the current literature on similarities and differences in heterosexual and homosexual mate preferences."

However, some research suggests that large age gaps are actually more common with low male income, at least in the general population. Here, we examine spousal age differences among the super wealthy (Forbes 400 list – the richest 400 individuals in the US). Men from the Forbes 400 on average had a spouse who was seven years younger, which is significantly different from the mean age difference between spouses in the US population. Furthermore when these men remarried, their subsequent spouse was substantially younger, twenty-two years younger on average, again markedly different from the general population. Wealthy women did not differ from the general population in terms of spousal age differences. We conclude that based on these data the stereotype that rich men (re)marry younger wives holds a kernel of truth, at least for a sample of the super wealthy."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPurpose: The experience sampling method (ESM) is used for intensive longitudinal time-series data collection during normal daily life. ESM data give information on momentary affect, activities and (social) context of, for example, patients suffering from mental disorders, and allows for person-specific feedback reports. However, current personalized feedback reports only display a selection of measured variables, and typically involve only summary statistics, thus not reflecting the dynamic fluctuations in affect and its influencing factors. To address this shortcoming, we developed a tool for dynamically visualizing ESM data. Methods: We introduce a new framework, ESMvis, for giving descriptive feedback, focusing on direct visualization of the dynamic nature of raw data. In this ESM feedback approach, raw ESM data are visualized using R software. We applied ESMvis to data collected for over 52 weeks on a patient diagnosed with an obsessive–compulsive disorder with comorbid depression. Results: We provided personalized feedback, in which both the overall trajectory and specific time moments were captured in a movie format. Two relapses during the study period could be visually determined, and subsequently confirmed by the therapist. The therapist and patient evaluated ESMvis as an insightful add-on tool to care-as-usual. Conclusion: ESMvis is a showcase on providing personalized feedback by dynamic visualization of ESM time-series data. Our tool is freely available and adjustable, making it widely applicable. In addition to potential applications in clinical practice, ESMvis can work as an exploratory tool that can lead to new hypotheses and inform more complex statistical techniques."

Researchers designing such data collections face a trade-off: When eliciting a high number of alters, study participation can be particularly burdensome as all data is obtained by surveying the ego. Eliciting a low number of alters, however, may incur bias in network characteristics. In the present study we use a sample of 701 Dutch women and their personal networks of 25 alters to investigate two strategies reducing respondent burden in personal network data collections: (1) eliciting fewer alters and (2) selecting a random subsample from the original set of elicited alters for full assessment. We present the amount of bias in structural and compositional network characteristics connected to applying these strategies for every possible network size (2–24 alters) as well as the potential study time savings as a proxy for respondent burden reduction. Our results can aid researchers designing a personal network study to balance respondent burden and bias in estimates for a range of compositional and structural network characteristics."

The status of the discipline, and its recent history, is far from straightforward, and debates among various schools of thought have been rather fraught at times. In what follows, we lay out the origins of Evolutionary Psychology, Human Behavioral Ecology and Gene-Culture Co-Evolutionary theory, explore their central tenets, and discuss the links between them. We also identify areas of tension, and discuss some of the criticisms advanced at these different approaches, both from within and outside the discipline. We emphasize the need for a more pluralist, biosocial stance in which cultural explanations are not considered distinct from biological ones, nor as complementary, but as fully intertwined."

Understanding this cross-study heterogeneity of reported preferred family size will contribute to the debates on the uncertainty of fertility in China. This paper quantified how much heterogeneity in aggregate-level fertility preferences can be explained by taking into account the demographic characteristics of the sample, its geographical location, and the measurement of fertility preferences. We retrieved 124 estimates of average preferred family size from 94 publications (from the year 2001 and onwards) in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI) and used mixed-effect meta-regression model to investigate heterogeneity. We found that the average preferred number of children in China since 2001 ranged from 0.91 to 2.88, with an average of 1.70 (SD = 0.26). Demographic differences accounted for 23%, human geographic regionalization for 21%, and the measurement of fertility preferences for 13% of the between-study variation. Sample characteristics (demographic and regional differences) and the measurement of fertility preferences together accounted for 46% of the variation in average preferred fertility. The averaged preferred family size varies by different characteristics and measurement. This study also points out whether particular groups have higher or lower preferences. It helps researchers to put estimates from fertility preferences from single studies in perspective. Moreover, this study can help resolve why researchers have such different outlooks on the future fertility of China."

The biology of telomeres dictates shortening with age, although telomere elongation with age has repeatedly been observed within a minority of individuals in several populations. These findings have been attributed to error, rather than actual telomere elongation, restricting our understanding of its possible biological significance. Here we present a method to distinguish between error and telomere elongation in longitudinal datasets, which is easy to apply and has few assumptions. Using simulations, we show that the method has considerable statistical power (&gt;80 %) to detect even a small proportion (6.7 %) of TL increases in the population, within a relatively small sample (N = 200), while maintaining the standard level of Type I error rate (α ≤ 0.05)."

Previous studies typically focused on the age at which people have their first child, but little is known about desired timing of parenthood and how this desire changes. Objective: In this study, we examined three facets of postponement: (1) desired age to have a first child, (2) changes in this desired age, and (3) whether the desires are met. Methods: We use data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (N = 2,296), which is a representative sample of men and women in the Netherlands who have been followed for up to ten years. Results: Men and women desire to have children at relatively high ages, i.e., around age 30. About half of the respondents update these desires by increasing the desired age as they get older. Half of respondents do not become a parent at their desired time. Conclusions: The high ages at first birth observed are due to a combination of the three facets of postponement. Contribution: This study contributes to the literature by showing that the high observed age at which people have children nowadays is due to high desired ages, updating these desires upwards, and not achieving their desired timing."

    "text": "Abstract\nResearch on genetic influences on human fertility outcomes such as number of children ever born (NEB) or the age at first childbirth (AFB) has been solely based on twin and family-designs that suffer from problematic assumptions and practical limitations. The current study exploits recent advances in the field of molecular genetics by applying the genomic-relationship-matrix based restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) methods to quantify for the first time the extent to which common genetic variants influence the NEB and the AFB of women. Using data from the UK and the Netherlands (N = 6,758), results show significant additive genetic effects on both traits explaining 10% (SE = 5) of the variance in the NEB and 15% (SE = 4) in the AFB. We further find a significant negative genetic correlation between AFB and NEB in the pooled sample of –0.62 (SE = 0.27, p-value = 0.02). This finding implies that individuals with genetic predispositions for an earlier AFB had a reproductive advantage and that natural selection operated not only in historical, but also in contemporary populations. The observed postponement in the AFB across the past century in Europe contrasts with these findings, suggesting an evolutionary override by environmental effects and underscoring that evolutionary predictions in modern human societies are not straight forward. It emphasizes the necessity for an integrative research design from the fields of genetics and social sciences in order to understand and predict fertility outcomes. Finally, our results suggest that we may be able to find genetic variants associated with human fertility when conducting GWAS-meta analyses with sufficient sample size."

Satisfaction with one’s own height and one’s partner height seem likely to be related to these preferences. Using a student sample (N = 650), we show that women are not only more selective, but also more consistent, than men, in their partner height preferences. Women prefer, on average, a larger height difference between themselves and their partner (i.e. males being much taller than themselves) than men do. This effect is even more pronounced when examining satisfaction with actual partner height: women are most satisfied when their partner was 21 cm taller, whereas men are most satisfied when they were 8 cm taller than their partner. Next, using data from our sample and that of a previously published study (N = 52,677), we show that for men, height is more important to the expression of satisfaction with one’s own height than it is for women. Furthermore, slightly above average height women and tall men are most satisfied with their heights. We conclude that satisfaction with one’s own height is at least partly a consequence of the height preference of the opposite sex and satisfaction with one’s partner height."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIntralocus sexual conflict (IASC) occurs when a trait under selection in one sex constrains the other sex from achieving its sex-specific fitness optimum. Selection pressures on body size often differ between the sexes across many species, including humans: among men individuals of average height enjoy the highest reproductive success, while shorter women have the highest reproductive success. Given its high heritability, IASC over human height is likely. Using data from sibling pairs from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, we present evidence for IASC over height: in shorter sibling pairs (relatively) more reproductive success (number of children) was obtained through the sister than through the brother of the sibling pair. By contrast, in average height sibling pairs most reproductive success was obtained through the brother relative to the sister. In conclusion, we show that IASC over a heritable, sexually dimorphic physical trait (human height) affects Darwinian fitness in a contemporary human population."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Social interactions are important for well-being, and therefore, researchers are increasingly attempting to capture people’s social environment. Many different disciplines have developed tools to measure the social environment, which can be highly variable over time. The experience sampling method (ESM) is often used in psychology to study the dynamics within a person and the social environment. In addition, passive sensing is often used to capture social behavior via sensors from smartphones or other wearable devices. Furthermore, sociologists use egocentric networks to track how social relationships are changing. Each of these methods is likely to tap into different but important parts of people’s social environment. Thus far, the development and implementation of these methods have occurred mostly separately from each other. Objective: Our aim was to synthesize the literature on how these methods are currently used to capture the changing social environment in relation to well-being and assess how to best combine these methods to study well-being. Methods: We conducted a scoping review according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results: We included 275 studies. In total, 3 important points follow from our review. First, each method captures a different but important part of the social environment at a different temporal resolution. Second, measures are rarely validated (&gt;70% of ESM studies and 50% of passive sensing studies were not validated), which undermines the robustness of the conclusions drawn. Third, a combination of methods is currently lacking (only 15/275, 5.5% of the studies combined ESM and passive sensing, and no studies combined all 3 methods) but is essential in understanding well-being. Conclusions: We highlight that the practice of using poorly validated measures hampers progress in understanding the relationship between the changing social environment and well-being. We conclude that different methods should be combined more often to reduce the participants’ burden and form a holistic perspective on the social environment."

We made use of GENSI, a recently developed tool for network data collection using interactive visual elements that has been shown to reduce respondent burden. A sample of 758 women between the ages of 18 and 40 were recruited through the LISS-panel; a longitudinal online survey of Dutch people. Respondents were asked to name exactly 25 alters, answer sixteen questions about these alters (name interpreter questions), and assess all 300 alter-alter relations. Nearly all (97%) respondents reported on 25 alters. Non-response was minimal: 92% of respondents had no missing values, and an additional 5% had fewer than 10% missing values. Listing 25 alters took 3.5 ± 2.2 (mean ± SD) minutes, and reporting on the ties between these alters took 3.6 ± 1.3 min. Answering all alter questions took longest with a time of 15.2 ± 5.3 min. The majority of respondents thought the questions were clear and easy to answer, and most enjoyed filling in the survey. Collecting large personal networks can mean a significant burden to respondents, but through the use of visual elements in the survey, it is clear that it can be done within reasonable time, with enjoyment and without much non-response."

Male and female police officers were taller than the average population. A larger percentage of women than of men was found in the lowest ranks, but in the leadership positions, there was a similar percentage of women as of men. Overall, but especially among women, height was linearly associated with occupational rank: the taller one was, the higher one’s rank. These effects were independent of educational level and age. The implications for evolutionary theorizing from the perspective of sexual selection on the effect of tallness on status and dominance among women are discussed."

    "text": "Abstract\nWestern scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) engage in a variety of cache-protection strategies to reduce the chances of cache theft by conspeci- fics. Many of these strategies revolve around reducing visual information to potential thieves. This study aimed to determine whether the jays also reduce auditory information during caching. Each jay was given the opportunity to cache food in two trays, one of which was filled with small pebbles that made considerable noise when cached in (‘noisy’ tray), whereas the other one contained soil that made little detectable noise when cached in (‘quiet’ tray). When the jays could be heard, but not seen, by a competitor, they cached proportionally less food items in the ‘noisy’ substrate than when they cached alone in the room, or when they could be seen and heard by competitors. These results suggest that western scrub-jays know when to conceal auditory information, namely when a competitor cannot see but can hear the caching event."

    "text": "Abstract\nMutual mate choice is prevalent in humans, where both males and females have a say in their choice of partner. How the choices made by one sex constrain the choice of the other remains poorly understood, however, because human studies have mostly limited themselves to measuring preferences. We used a sample of 5782 speed-daters making 128104 choices to link preferences for partner height to actual choice and the formation of a match (the mutual expression of interest to meet again). We show that sexual conflict at the level of preferences is translated into choice: women were most likely to choose a speed-dater 25 cm taller than themselves, whereas men were most likely to choose women only 7 cm shorter than themselves. As a consequence, matches were most likely at an intermediate height difference (19 cm) that differed significantly from the preferred height difference of both sexes. Thus, our study reveals how mutual mate choice can result in suboptimal pair formation for both sexes, highlighting the importance of assessing the mate choice process in its entirety."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe Dutch are the tallest people on earth. Over the last 200 years, they have grown 20 cm in height: a rapid rate of increase that points to environmental causes. This secular trend in height is echoed across allWestern populations, but came to an end, or at least levelled off, much earlier than in The Netherlands. One possibility, then, is that natural selection acted congruently with these environmentally induced changes to further promote tall stature among the people of the lowlands. Using data from the LifeLines study, which follows a large sample of the population of the north of The Netherlands (n = 94 516), we examined how height was related to measures of reproductive success (as a proxy for fitness). Across three decades (1935–1967), height was consistently related to reproductive output (number of children born and number of surviving children), favouring taller men and average height women. This was despite a later age at first birth for taller individuals. Furthermore, even in this low-mortality population, taller women experienced higher child survival, which contributed positively to their increased reproductive success. Thus,natural selection in addition to good environmental conditions may help explain why the Dutch are so tall."

Further, we considered whether antonyms are key arguments in the inferences that license contrast. We looked at the frequency of both indirect and direct antonym pairs in contrastive sentences marked with but and sentences with antonym pairs without but. Antonyms and but co-occurred in only 1% of the 218,017 sentences studied. However, in 81% of but marked sentences with true antonyms pairs, the feature the antonyms described was a source of the contrast. In the non-but marked sentences, antonymy alone was a poor predictor, licensing a contrast in only 15% of the cases. We also found that direct antonyms are better predictors of contrast than indirect antonyms, and certain antonym pairs, like same-different, are consistently good predictors. These results could be used to find unmarked contrast relations with antonyms alone."

Results corroborate previous findings by showing that across these domains men are more inclined to take risks than women. We discuss how these findings might be used in an applied context."

    "text": "Abstract\nObjectives: Although male height is positively associated with many aspects of mate quality, average height men attain higher reproductive success in US populations. We hypothesize that this is because the advantages associated with taller stature accrue mainly from not being short, rather than from being taller than average. Lower fertility by short men may be a consequence of their and their partner’s lower scores on aspects of mate quality. Taller men, although they score higher on mate quality compared to average height men, may have lower fertility because they are more likely to be paired with taller women, who are potentially less fertile. Methods: We analyzed data from The Integrated Health Interview Series (IHIS) of the United States (N = 165,606). Segmented regression was used to examine patterns across the height continuum. Results: On all aspects of own and partner quality, shorter men scored lower than both average height and taller men. Height more strongly predicted these aspects when moving from short to average height, than when moving from average to taller heights. Women of a given height who scored lower on mate quality also had shorter partners. Conclusions: Shorter men faced a double disadvantage with respect to both their own mate quality and that of their spouses. Scores of taller men were only marginally higher than those of average height men, suggesting that being tall is less important than not being short. Although effect sizes were small, our results may partly explain why shorter and taller men have lower fertility than those of average stature."

    "text": "Abstract\nAccording to both the scientific literature and popular media, all one needs to win a US presidential election is to be taller than one’s opponent. Yet, such claims are often based on an arbitrary selection of elections, and inadequate statistical analysis. Using data on all presidential elections, we show that height is indeed an important factor in the US presidential elections. Candidates that were taller than their opponents received more popular votes, although they were not significantly more likely to win the actual election. Taller presidents were also more likely to be reelected. In addition, presidents were, on average, much taller than men from the same birth cohort. The advantage of taller candidates is potentially explained by perceptions associated with height: taller presidents are rated by experts as ‘greater’, and having more leadership and communication skills. We conclude that height is an important characteristic in choosing and evaluating political leaders."

We also outline possible biological explanations for our findings. Methods: We used data from a long‐term study of 5,326 female Wisconsin high school graduates to examine the association between female height and reproductive success. Twenty‐one samples on this association were covered by our literature review. Results: Shorter women had more children surviving to age 18 than taller women, despite increased child mortality in shorter women. Taller women had a higher age at first birth and age at first marriage and reached a higher social status, but the negative effect of height on reproductive success persisted after controlling for these variables. However, while these effects were quite consistent in Western populations, they were not consistently present in non‐Western populations. Our review also indicated that child mortality was almost universally higher among shorter women. Conclusions: We conclude that shorter women have a higher number of live births but that final reproductive success depends on the positive effect of height on child survival."

Although we know much about human height, this information has rarely been brought together in a comprehensive, systematic fashion. Here, we present a synthetic review of the literature on human height from an explicit evolutionary perspective, addressing its phylogenetic history, development, and environmental and genetic influences on growth and stature. In addition to presenting evidence to suggest the past action of natural selection on human height, we also assess the evidence that natural and sexual selection continues to act on height in contemporary populations. Although there is clear evidence to suggest that selection acts on height, mainly through life‐history processes but perhaps also directly, it is also apparent that methodological factors reduce the confidence with which such inferences can be drawn, and there remain surprising gaps in our knowledge. The inability to draw firm conclusions about the adaptiveness of such a highly visible and easily measured trait suggests we should show an appropriate degree of caution when dealing with other human traits in evolutionary perspective."

The contested nature of evolutionary psychology lies not in our status as evolved beings, but in the extent to which evolutionary ideas add value to studies of human behavior, and the rigor with which these ideas are tested. This, in turn, is linked to the framework in which particular evolutionary ideas are situated. While the framing of the current research topic places the brain-as-computer metaphor in opposition to evolutionary psychology, the most prominent school of thought in this field (born out of cognitive psychology, and often known as the Santa Barbara school) is entirely wedded to the computational theory of mind as an explanatory framework. Its unique aspect is to argue that the mind consists of a large number of functionally specialized (i.e., domain-specific) computational mechanisms, or modules (the massive modularity hypothesis). Far from offering an alternative to, or an improvement on, the current perspective, we argue that evolutionary psychology is a mainstream computational theory, and that its arguments for domain-specificity often rest on shaky premises. We then go on to suggest that the various forms of e-cognition (i.e., embodied, embedded, enactive) represent a true alternative to standard computational approaches, with an emphasis on “cognitive integration” or the “extended mind hypothesis” in particular. We feel this offers the most promise for human psychology because it incorporates the social and historical processes that are crucial to human “mind-making” within an evolutionarily informed framework. In addition to linking to other research areas in psychology, this approach is more likely to form productive links to other disciplines within the social sciences, not least by encouraging a healthy pluralism in approach."

Conflicts can also occur between groups, but it is unknown whether conflicts also escalate more when groups are more similar in RHP. We tested this hypothesis in humans, using data from two professional sports competitions: football (the Bundesliga, the German first division of football) and basketball (the NBA, the North American National Basketball Association). We defined RHP based on the league ranks of the teams involved in the competition (i.e. their competitive ability) and measured conflict escalation by the number of fouls committed. We found that in both sports the number of fouls committed increased when the difference in RHP was smaller. Thus, we provide what is to our best knowledge the first evidence that, as in conflicts between individuals, conflicts escalate more when groups are more similar in RHP."

    "text": "Abstract\nIs fertility relevant to evolutionary analyses conducted in modern industrial societies? This question has been the subject of a highly contentious debate, beginning in the late 1980s and continuing to this day. Researchers in both evolutionary and social sciences have argued that the measurement of fitness-related traits (e.g., fertility) offers little insight into evolutionary processes, on the grounds that modern industrial environments differ so greatly from those of our ancestral past that our behavior can no longer be expected to be adaptive. In contrast, we argue that fertility measurements in industrial society are essential for a complete evolutionary analysis: in particular, such data can provide evidence for any putative adaptive mismatch between ancestral environments and those of the present day, and they can provide insight into the selection pressures currently operating on contemporary populations. Having made this positive case, we then go on to discuss some challenges of fertility-related analyses among industrialized populations, particularly those that involve large-scale databases. These include ‘researcher degrees of freedom’ (i.e., the choices made about which variables to analyze and how) and the different biases that may exist in such data. Despite these concerns, large datasets from multiple populations represent an excellent opportunity to test evolutionary hypotheses in great detail, enriching the evolutionary understanding of human behavior."

    "text": "Abstract\nThere is continuing debate on how low China’s fertility has reached and whether China has fallen into the “low fertility trap”. This paper addresses this debate by revisiting the trends in fertility preferences in the past decades in China based on a meta review. Moreover, the analysis contrasts distinct measurements of fertility preferences to capture different aspects of reproductive decision-making. This papers reviews 152 studies resulting in 137 estimates for the mean of preferred number of children, 104 estimates for the proportions of different numbers of children preferred and 66 estimates for the second-child preferences. We found that after the long-time decline of fertility preferences in the last century, the average family size remained at a low level but started to increase slowly since 2001. This upturn was observed for all three types of measurements of fertility preferences: ideal, desired, and planned family size. The results also indicate a strong two-child preference (more than 50% of respondents) in China, although 30% of people prefer one child and only a small fraction indicating an ideal family size for three or more children. Results on people’s preference for a second child were less consistent. We concluded that fertility is unlikely to increase rapidly in China even when the government adopts more relaxed family planning policy. Because the upward trend in fertility preferences was very minimal and the economic constraints will prevent many people to realise their preferences."

Genetic scores derived from genome-wide association studies explain only a fraction of the heritability estimates obtained from whole-genome studies on single populations, known as the ‘hidden heritability’ puzzle. Using seven sampling populations (n = 35,062), we test whether hidden heritability is attributed to heterogeneity across sampling populations and time, showing that estimates are substantially smaller across populations compared with within populations. We show that the hidden heritability varies substantially: from zero for height to 20% for body mass index, 37% for education, 40% for age at first birth and up to 75% for number of children. Simulations demonstrate that our results are more likely to reflect heterogeneity in phenotypic measurement or gene–environment interactions than genetic heterogeneity. These findings have substantial implications for genetic discovery, suggesting that large homogenous datasets are required for behavioural phenotypes and that gene–environment interaction may be a central challenge for genetic discovery."

Most friends were met at school (&gt;70%) and 20% of family were considered friends. Friendships were often close relationships with more non-face-to-face contact, while meeting in person was less predictive. Relatively older women reported fewer friends. Even in this homogenous sample with multiple measures of tie strength, friendships were difficult to predict and often overlapped with other social roles, meaning that researchers should be careful in using friendship as distinct category."

    "text": "Abstract\nMore than 30% of all pregnancies in the UK require some form of assistance at delivery, with one of the more severe forms of assistance being an emergency Caesarean section (ECS). Previously it has been shown that the likelihood of a delivery via ECS is positively associated with the birth weight and size of the newborn and negatively with maternal height. Paternal height affects skeletal growth and mass of the fetus, and thus might also affect pregnancy outcomes. We hypothesized that the effect of newborn birth weight on the risk of ECS would decrease with increasing maternal height. Similarly, we predicted that there would be an increase in ECS risk as a function of paternal height, but that this effect would be relative to maternal height (i.e., parental height differences). We used data from the Millennium Cohort Study: a large-scale survey (N = 18,819 births) with data on babies born and their parents from the United Kingdom surveyed 9 to 12-months after birth. We found that in primiparous women, both maternal height and parental height differences interacted with birth weight and predicted the likelihood of an ECS. When carrying a heavy newborn, the risk of ECS was more than doubled for short women (46.3%) compared to tall women (21.7%), in agreement with earlier findings. For women of average height carrying a heavy newborn while having a relatively short compared to tall partner reduced the risk by 6.7%. In conclusion, the size of the baby, the height of the mother and parental height differences affect the likelihood of an ECS in primiparous women."

We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth in the United States (N=4,198 women) and apply both logistic regression models to examine the role of childlessness desires early in life, and multilevel models for repeated measures to examine the role of childlessness expectations throughout the life course. We find that higher educational attainment and LFP are positively associated with childlessness. We do not find, however, that higher educated and working women more often desire or expect to remain childless. In contrast, we find that among women who ultimately remain childless, those women who work fulltime and have higher status occupations have higher expectations to have children throughout their life course. These results suggest that education and occupation produce constraints, resulting in the postponement of childbearing which hinders women in realizing their desires and expectations. Since many working women remain childless despite the desire and expectation to become a mother, our findings stress the importance of work-life reconciliation. It furthermore highlights the importance of increasing public awareness regarding the decrease in fecundity with age."

A typical finding in Western societies is that women prefer men who are taller than themselves and, equivalently, men prefer women who are shorter than themselves. However, recent reports in non-Western societies (e.g., the Himba in Namibia) challenge the view on the universality of such preferences. Here we report on male and female height preferences in two non-Western populations—the Hadza (Tanzania) and the Tsimane’ (Bolivia)—and the relationships between body height preferences and the height of actual partners. In the Hadza, most individuals preferred a sexual dimorphism in stature (SDS) with the man being much taller than the woman. Preferences for SDS and actual partner SDS were positively and significantly correlated in both men and women, suggesting that people who preferred larger height differences also had larger height differences with their partners. In the Tsimane’, the majority of men preferred an SDS with the man being taller than the woman, but women did not show such a preference. Unlike in the Hadza, SDS preference was not significantly correlated to actual partner SDS. We conclude that patterns of height preferences and choices in the Hadza and Tsimane’ are different than those observed in Western societies, and discuss possible causes for the observed differences between non-Western and Western societies."

Contemporary English language is also riddled with phrases that highlight an association between size and status (or the lack of it)—“a man of stature”, ‘standing tall’, ‘he was belittled’—and the phrase ‘high status’ itself incorporates a vertical dimension. This conflation of size and status across many different language groups and cultures has a rather straightforward explanation: on average, those in position of power or high in status, tend to be taller and bigger than those who are not. Positive associations between size and status have been observed in all kinds of cultural groupings, from hunter-gatherer groups to agricultural populations to industrialised societies (B. J.

Whereas females were consistently more intrasexually competitive the higher the socio-economic status of their parents, males with parents of the lowest socio-economic status tended to be more intrasexually competitive than those with parents of medium socio-economic status, and nearly as intrasexually competitive as those with parents of high socio-economic status. Only among adolescents with parents of low socio-economic status were males more intrasexually competitive than females. Among males and females, higher levels of intrasexual competitiveness were related to a higher family income, to a higher occupational status of the father as well as of the mother, and to a higher educational level of the mother. Only among females were higher levels of intrasexual competitiveness associated with a higher educational level of the father. Males whose fathers had only elementary education had a relatively high level of intrasexual competitiveness. The results are discussed in the context of the multifaceted nature of human status, and the potential relevance of intrasexual competitiveness for individuals of high versus low social status."

    "text": "Abstract\nFertility intentions as verbalized in surveys are a poor predictor of actual fertility outcomes, the number of children people have. This can partly be explained by the uncertainty people have in their intentions. Such uncertainties are hard to capture through traditional survey questions, although open-ended questions can be used to get insight into people’s subjective narratives of the future that determine their intentions. An- alyzing such answers to open-ended questions can be done through Natural Language Process- ing techniques. Traditional topic models (e.g., LSA and LDA), however, often fail to do since they rely on co-occurrences, which are often rare in short survey responses. The aim of this study was to apply and evaluate topic models on demographic survey data. In this study, we applied neural topic models (e.g. BERTopic, CombinedTM) based on language models to responses from Dutch women on their fertil- ity plans, and compared the topics and their coherence scores from each model to expert judgments. Our results show that neural mod- els produce topics more in line with human interpretation compared to LDA. However, the coherence score could only partly reflect on this, depending on the method and corpus used for calculation. This research is important be- cause, first, it helps us develop more informed strategies on model selection and evaluation for topic modeling on survey data; and second, it shows that the field of demography has much to gain from adopting novel NLP methods."

However, due to constraining factors such as availability of mates, rival competition, and mutual mate choice, preferred characteristics may not be realised in the actual partner. People value height in their partner and we investigated to what extent preferences for height are realised in actual couples. We used data from the Millennium Cohort Study (UK) and compared the distribution of height difference in actual couples to simulations of random mating to test how established mate preferences map on to actual mating patterns. In line with mate preferences, we found evidence for: (i) assortative mating (r = .18), (ii) the male-taller norm, and, for the first time, (iii) for the male-not-too-tall norm. Couples where the male partner was shorter, or over 25 cm taller than the female partner, occurred at lower frequency in actual couples than expected by chance, but the magnitude of these effects was modest. We also investigated another preference rule, namely that short women (and tall men) prefer large height differences with their partner, whereas tall women (and short men) prefer small height differences. These patterns were also observed in our population, although the strengths of these associations were weaker than previously reported strength of preferences. We conclude that while preferences for partner height generally translate into actual pairing, they do so only modestly."

    "text": "Abstract\nMedia reports often emphasize how the height of US presidential candidates plays an important role in election outcomes, with taller candidates winning an overwhelming number of elections across time. These claims are, however, rarely backed up by any form of reliable statistical analysis. Even when statistical methods are employed, they are often inadequate to the task. This case study discusses how to analyse presidential candidate height in relation to election success, showing how to calculate probabilities by hand, how to conduct a binomial test and how to perform randomization tests."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nStudies of the association between wealth and fertility in industrial populations have a rich history in the evolutionary literature, and they have been used to argue both for and against a behavioral ecological approach to explaining human variability. We consider that there are strong arguments in favor of measuring fertility (and proxies thereof) in industrial populations, not least because of the wide availability of large-scale secondary databases. Such data sources bring challenges as well as advantages, however. The purpose of this article is to illustrate these by examining the association between wealth and reproductive success in the United States, using the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979. We conduct a broad-based exploratory analysis of the relationship between wealth and fertility, employing both cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches, and multiple measures of both wealth (income and net worth) and fertility (lifetime reproductive success and transitions to first, second and third births). We highlight the kinds of decisions that have to be made regarding sample selection, along with the selection and construction of explanatory variables and control measures. Based on our analyses, we find a positive effect of both income and net worth on fertility for men, which is more pronounced for white men and for transitions to first and second births. Income tends to have a negative effect on fertility for women, while net worth is more likely to positively predict fertility. Different reproductive strategies among different groups within the same population highlight the complexity of the reproductive ecology of industrial societies. These results differ in a number of respects from other analyses using the same database. We suggest this reflects the impossibility of producing a definitive analysis, rather than a failure to identify the ‘correct’ analytical strategy. Finally, we discuss how these findings inform us about (mal)adaptive decision-making."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nGiven the heritability of human left-handedness and its purported associations with fitness-lowering traits, the persistence of the minority of left-handedness in human populations is an evolutionary puzzle. The fighting hypothesis proposes that these negative fitness costs are offset by fitness gains for left-handers when involved in fights with right-handers, as being a minority would generate a surprise effect increasing the chance of winning. The finding that left-handers are overrepresented in many combat sports is interpreted as evidence for this hypothesis. However, few studies have examined sports that show good similarity with realistic fights and analysed winning chances in relation to handedness of both fighters. We examined both, in a sample of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a fierce fighting sport hardly constrained by rules. Left-handers were strongly overrepresented as compared to the general male population but no advantage for left-handers when facing right-handers was found, providing only partial evidence for the fighting hypothesis."

    "text": "Abstract\nObjectives: The study of assortative mating for height has a rich history in human biology. Although the positive correlation between the stature of spouses has often been noted in western populations, recent papers suggest that mating patterns for stature are not universal. The objective of this paper was to review the published evidence to examine the strength of and universality in assortative mating for height. Methods: We conducted an extensive literature review and meta‐analysis. We started with published reviews but also searched through secondary databases. Our search led to 154 correlations of height between partners. We classified the populations as western and non‐western based on geography. These correlations were then analyzed via meta‐analytic techniques. Results: 148 of the correlations for partner heights were positive and the overall analysis indicates moderate positive assortative mating (r = .23). Although assortative mating was slightly stronger in countries that can be described as western compared to non‐western, this difference was not statistically significant. We found no evidence for a change in assortative mating for height over time. There was substantial residual heterogeneity in effect sizes and this heterogeneity was most pronounced in western countries. Conclusions: Positive assortative mating for height exists in human populations, but is modest in magnitude suggesting that height is not a major factor in mate choice. Future research is necessary to understand the underlying causes of the large amount of heterogeneity observed in the degree of assortative mating across human populations, which may stem from a combination of methodological and ecological differences."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe fertility decline associated with economic development has been attributed to a host of interrelated causes including the rising costs of children with industrialization, and shifts in family structure. One hypothesis is that kin may impart more pro-natal information within their networks than non-kin, and that this effect may be exacerbated in networks with high kin-density where greater social conformity would be expected. In this study, we tested these ideas using large personal networks (25 associates of the respondent) collected from a sample of Dutch women (N = 706). Kin (parents) were perceived to exert slightly more social pressure to have children than non-kin, although dense networks were not associated with greater pressure. In contrast, women reported talking to friends about having children to a greater extent than kin, although greater kin-density in the network increased the likelihood of women reporting that they could talk to kin about having children. Both consanguineal and affinal kin could be asked to help with child-care to a greater extent than friends and other non-kin. Overall, there was mixed evidence that kin were more likely to offer pro-natal information than non-kin, and better evidence to suggest that kin were considered to be a better source of child-care support."

    "text": "Abstract\nMale facial width-to-height ratio (bizygomatic width scaled for face height) is a testosterone-linked trait predictive of reactive aggression, exploitative behavior, cheating, deception, and dominance. We tested whether facial width was systematically related to cause of death in a forensic sample. We hypothesized that wider-faced males, being more aggressive and robust, would be less likely than narrower-faced males to die from contact violence (stabbed, strangled, or bludgeoned to death) compared with other forms of homicide. We tested this hypothesis in a forensic data sample covering 523 male and 339 female skeletons. In these data, men with narrower faces were more likely to have died as a consequence of homicides involving direct physical contact than men with wider faces. No such effect was found for women. This effect was found when considering all causes of mortality and when limiting the sample to homicides. This finding suggests that wider-faced males are less likely to die from male–male physical violence, perhaps because of their formidability. Our findings are discussed with reference to the previous literature indicating that facial width-to-height ratio is a marker for male dominance."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAcross cultures, taller stature is linked to increased social status, but the potential reasons why this should be are unclear. One potential explanation is that taller individuals are more likely to win a dyadic confrontation with a competitor (i.e., they are more dominant), which leads to higher social rank. Although some previous studies have shown that perceptions of status or dominance are related to height, and are therefore consistent with such an explanation, there is surprisingly little research testing whether height actually has any influence on the behavioural outcomes in real-life social interactions. Here, we present three naturalistic observational studies demonstrating that height predicts interpersonal dominance during brief dyadic interactions. Study 1 investigated the likelihood of giving way in a narrow passage (N = 92); Study 2 investigated giving way in a busy shopping street, plus the likelihood of colliding with another individual (N = 1,108); and Study 3 investigated the likelihood of maintaining a linear path while walking, and potentially entering another individual’s personal space (N = 1,056). We conclude that human height is positively related to interpersonal dominance, and may well contribute to the widely observed positive association between height and social status."

    "text": "Abstract\nField data often include multiple observations taken from the same individual. In order to avoid pseudoreplication, it is commonplace to aggregate data, generating a mean score per individual, and then using these aggregated data in subsequent analyses. Aggregation, however, can generate problems of its own. Not only does it lead to a loss of information, it can also leave analyses vulnerable to the “ecological fallacy”: the drawing of false inferences about individual behavior on the basis of population level (“ecological”) data. It can also result in Simpson’s paradox, where relationships seen at the individual level can be completely reversed when analyzed at the aggregate level. These phenomena have been documented widely in the medical and social sciences but tend to go unremarked in primatological studies that rely on observational data from the field. Here, we provide a conceptual guide that explains how and why aggregate data are vulnerable to the ecological fallacy and Simpson’s paradox, illustrating these points using data on baboons. We then discuss one particular analytical approach, namely multi‐level modeling, that can potentially eliminate these problems. By highlighting the issue of the ecological fallacy, and increasing awareness of how datasets are often organized into a number of different levels, we also highlight the manner in which researchers can more positively exploit the structure of their datasets, without any information loss. These analytical approaches may thus provide greater insight into behavior by permitting more thorough investigation of interactions and cross‐level effects."

From being one of the shortest European populations in the 19th Century, the Dutch grew some 20 cm and are currently the tallest population in the world. Wealth, hygiene, and diet are well-established contributors to this major increase in height. Some have suggested that natural selection may also contribute to the trend, but evidence is weak. Here, we investigate the potential role of natural selection in the increase in height through simulations. We first ask what if natural selection was solely responsible for the observed increase in height? If the increase in average height was fully due to natural selection on male height, then across six consecutive generations, men who were two standard deviation above average height would need to have eight times more children on average. If selection acted only through those who have the opportunity to reproduce, then reproduction would need to be restricted to the tallest third (37%) of the population in order to give rise to the stark increase in height over time. No linear relationship between height and child mortality is able to account for the increase over time. We then present simulations based on previously observed estimates of partnership, mortality, selection and heritability and show that natural selection had a negligible effect (estimates from 0.07 to 0.36 cm) on the increase in height in the period 1850 to 2000. Our simulations highlight the plasticity of height and how remarkable the trend in height is in evolutionary terms. Only by using a combination of methods and insights from different disciplines, including biology, demography, and history are we potentially able to address how much of the increase in height is due to natural selection versus other causes.\n\n\nRead-in template\nI made a template that each talk should conform to and stored it into an .md file.

    "text": "I have a new website. The reason is that the old website partly stopped functioning, because I relied on the Hugo Academic theme. This theme got commercialised and some functionality stopped working. I decided to turn to a Quarto website, which is much better because I understand the underlying code better.\nMy process is something like: I love making a new website, change a lot, update it frequently in the first weeks. Then I lose interest. Five years after I do a complete rehaul. That’s where we are now. I have a problem.\nI browsed the interweb to see if there were nice, Quarto-based websites, and stumbled upon this: Real World Data Science. Another one that I liked was ellakaye.co.uk, from which I copied the logo in the upper left corner.\nUseful for the website, was the installation of Font Awesome and Academicons through these Quarto-plugins (FA and Academicons)\nThe biggest ‘problem’ was that I had lists of publications, blogs, and talks that included Hugo-code. For many of these files, I had to change the YAML at the start of each file. The below describes how I automatised this process."
