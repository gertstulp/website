<p>Background Although the application of self-monitoring (ambulatory assessment) and visual feedback in psychological interventions has yielded promising results, there are currently no reports on using self-monitoring and feedback during a complete therapy. The online m-Path platform provides a tailorable framework for integrating self-monitoring and visual feedback within different psychological interventions. Methods Therapy-specific questionnaires and visual feedback were developed within the online m-Path platform as part of the Feeling Safe-NL trial (registration number: ISRCTN25766661) for regular CBT for psychosis (CBTp) and the Feeling Safe Programme combined with peer counselling (the Feeling Safe-NL Programme). The design process involved people with lived experience, psychologists, peer counsellors, researchers, and software developers. The design principles included that the system should be 1) easy to use, 2) suitable for use during a six-month therapy, 3) focussed on positive and goal-aligned outcomes, 4) understandable by patients and professionals, and 5) informing, guiding, and promoting therapy. Design principles were evaluated using compliance data and a patient questionnaire. Results The system was used by 21 patients, of which nine completed the questionnaires for the full therapy period, 168 days on average. Usability data from patients revealed that the system was easy to use, well-explained, and suitable for use over six months of therapy. The patients also reported that the questions overall positively affected their emotions and that the feedback was insightful. Conclusion The results support the successful application of the design principles to promote the integration of the self-monitoring and visual feedback system within specific CBTp interventions.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="description">Description</h2>
<p>People’s networks are considered an important factor in explaining whether people want and have children. Existing research has rarely quantified how well we can predict fertility outcomes, and the importance of networks relative to other factors is entirely unknown. Here we use unique data from a representative sample of Dutch women reporting on over 18000 relationships. We use several machine learning techniques, ranging in complexity from LASSO regression to Graph Neural Networks, to examine how well we can predict five different fertility preference variables. Top models accounted for 5 to 45% of the out-of- sample variation in the different outcomes. Tree-based methods (e.g., XGBoost) performed best but only by a small margin. Graph Neural Networks required least preprocessing of the data and led to high predictive ability scores and thus presents a useful tool for personal network analyses. We discuss how the differences in predictive ability across different techniques are useful in understanding what traditional models may miss. We further discuss to what extent our results provide support for different mechanisms of social influence, and conclude that particularly those people in the network desiring children or those choosing to be childfree are important and understudied.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="description">Description</h2>
<p>A data challenge is a competition where many researchers work on the same dataset to make the best predictions of a well-defined outcome. Clear measures of predictive ability allow easy comparison of the strength of models and encourage participants to improve upon existing benchmarks. Data challenges led to major progress in data science by fostering the development of new algorithms with increasing predictive ability. Data challenges can also accelerate scientific progress because the ability to compare different models gives insights into the research problem at hand. However, in the social sciences data challenges are still rare. Here we present results of the first data challenge in population research, the Predicting Fertility (PreFer) data challenge. Hundreds of researchers engaged in the first phase of the data challenge where they used Dutch survey data to predict who had a child in 2021-2023 based on thousands of variables from 2007-2020. Selected researchers were also invited to work with Dutch administrative data to predict the same outcome. This setup provided a unique opportunity to study the limits of the predictability of fertility. Models combining theoretical knowledge about fertility behaviour and advanced machine learning algorithms outperformed theory-driven models in terms of predictive ability, providing novel insights into the complexity of fertility behaviour. We discuss the limits of predictability of fertility and how survey data and administrative data place different constraints on predictive ability. We further discuss how data-driven approaches can complement theory-driven research and how data science techniques can advance population research.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Uncertainty in fertility intentions is a major obstacle to understanding contemporary trends in fertility decision-making and its outcomes. Quantifying this uncertainty by structural factors such as income, ethnicity, and housing conditions is recognized as insufficient. A recently proposed framework on subjective narratives has opened up a new way to gauge factors behind fertility decision-making and uncertainty. Through surveys, such narratives can be elicited with open-ended questions (OEQs). However, analyzing answers to OEQs typically involves extensive human coding, imposing constraints on sample size. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques assist researchers in grasping aspects of the underlying reasoning behind responses with much less human effort. In this study, using automatic neural topic modeling methods, we identify and interpret topics and themes underlying the narratives on fertility intention uncertainty of women in the Netherlands. We used Contextualized Topic Models (CTMs), a neural topic model using pre-trained representations of Dutch language, to conduct our analyses. Our results show that nine topics dominate the narratives about fertility planning, with age and health-related issues as the most prominent ones. In addition, we found that uncertainty in fertility intentions is not homogeneous, as women who feel uncertain due to real-life constraints and those who have no fertility plans at all put their stress on vastly different narratives.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Passive smartphone measures hold significant potential and are increasingly employed in psychological and biomedical research to capture an individual’s behavior. These measures involve the near-continuous and unobtrusive collection of data from smartphones without requiring active input from participants. For example, GPS sensors are used to determine the (social) context of a person, and accelerometers to measure movement. However, utilizing passive smartphone measures presents methodological challenges during data collection and analysis. Researchers must make multiple decisions when working with such measures, which can result in different conclusions. Unfortunately, the transparency of these decision-making processes is often lacking. The implementation of open science practices is only beginning to emerge in digital phenotyping studies and varies widely across studies. Well-intentioned researchers may fail to report on some decisions due to the variety of choices that must be made. To address this issue and enhance reproducibility in digital phenotyping studies, we propose the adoption of preregistration as a way forward. Although there have been some attempts to preregister digital phenotyping studies, a template for registering such studies is currently missing. This could be problematic due to the high level of complexity that requires a well-structured template. Therefore, our objective was to develop a preregistration template that is easy to use and understandable for researchers. Additionally, we explain this template and provide resources to assist researchers in making informed decisions regarding data collection, cleaning, and analysis. Overall, we aim to make researchers’ choices explicit, enhance transparency, and elevate the standards for studies utilizing passive smartphone measures.</p>

<p>Our society faces a great diversity of opportunities for youth. The 10-year Growing Up Together in Society (GUTS) program has the long-term goal to understand which combination of measures best predict societal trajectories, such as school success, mental health, well-being, and developing a sense of belonging in society. Our leading hypothesis is that self-regulation is key to how adolescents successfully navigate the demands of contemporary society. We aim to test these questions using socio-economic, questionnaire (including experience sampling methods), behavioral, brain (fMRI, sMRI, EEG), hormonal, and genetic measures in four large cohorts including adolescents and young adults. Two cohorts are designed as test and replication cohorts to test the developmental trajectory of self-regulation, including adolescents of different socioeconomic status thereby bridging individual, family, and societal perspectives. The third cohort consists of an entire social network to examine how neural and self-regulatory development influences and is influenced by whom adolescents and young adults choose to interact with. The fourth cohort includes youth with early signs of antisocial and delinquent behavior to understand patterns of societal development in individuals at the extreme ends of self-regulation and societal participation, and examines pathways into and out of delinquency. We will complement the newly collected cohorts with data from existing large-scale population-based and case-control cohorts. The study is embedded in a transdisciplinary approach that engages stakeholders throughout the design stage, with a strong focus on citizen science and youth participation in study design, data collection, and interpretation of results, to ensure optimal translation to youth in society.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The social sciences have produced an impressive body of research on determinants of fertility outcomes, or whether and when people have children. However, the strength of these determinants and underlying theories are rarely evaluated on their predictive ability on new data. This prevents us from systematically comparing studies, hindering the evaluation and accumulation of knowledge. In this paper, we present two datasets which can be used to study the predictability of fertility outcomes in the Netherlands. One dataset is based on the LISS panel, a longitudinal survey which includes thousands of variables on a wide range of topics, including individual preferences and values. The other is based on the Dutch register data which lacks attitudinal data but includes detailed information about the life courses of millions of Dutch residents. We provide information about the datasets and the samples, and describe the fertility outcome of interest. We also introduce the fertility prediction data challenge PreFer which is based on these datasets and will start in Spring 2024. We outline the ways in which measuring the predictability of fertility outcomes using these datasets and combining their strengths in the data challenge can advance our understanding of fertility behaviour and computational social science. We further provide details for participants on how to take part in the data challenge.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The daily social life of a person can be captured with different methodologies. Two methods that are especially promising are personal-social-network (PSN) data collection and experience-sampling methodology (ESM). Whereas PSN data collections ask participants to provide information on their social relationships and broader social environment, ESM studies collect intensive longitudinal data on social interactions in daily life using multiple short surveys per day. In combination, the two methods enable detailed insights into someone’s social life, including information on interactions with specific interaction partners from the personal network. Despite many potential uses of such data integration, there are few studies to date using the two methods in conjunction. This is likely due to their complexity and lack of software that allows capturing the full social life of someone while keeping the burden for participants and researchers sufficiently low. In this article, we report on the development of methodology and software for an ESM/PSN integration within the established ESM tool m-Path. We describe results of a first study using the developed tool that illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method combination and show that participants consider the assessments insightful. We further outline study-design choices and ethical considerations when combining the two methodologies. We hope to encourage applications of the presented methods in research and practice across different fields.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>People’s fertility preferences are often considered an important determinant of fertility. What is often neglected in studies of preferred fertility, is the uncertainty that people may have about their preferences. In this study, using data on Dutch women through the Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences (collected early 2018), we examined women’s fertility preferences and asked detailed questions about the certainty of these preferences. We also examined whether women agreed with their partner on preferred family size, and to what extent partner (dis)agreement shaped uncertainty. We show that Dutch women expressed much uncertainty about their fertility preferences, with only one-third feeling strongly about their preferences. Uncertainty strongly increased when women preferred higher numbers of children, whereas already having children reduced it. Women who wanted no children were most certain about their preference. Higher preferred family sizes also led to more disagreement with the partner about these preferences, and greater partner disagreement, in turn, led to more uncertainty. These findings imply that people are more likely to downgrade their fertility preferences than to increase them, as women are more certain about their preferences for lower numbers of children and are more open to family sizes below than above their preferred choice. Partner disagreement is often resolved by not having (more) children, lowering realised fertility. Hence, these findings provide another explanation for why many people have fewer children than desired.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The use of smartphones and wearable sensors to passively collect data on behavior has great potential for better understanding psychological well-being and mental disorders with minimal burden. However, there are important methodological challenges that may hinder the widespread adoption of these passive measures. A crucial one is the issue of timescale: The chosen temporal resolution for summarizing and analyzing the data may affect how results are interpreted. Despite its importance, the choice of temporal resolution is rarely justified. In this study, we aim to improve current standards for analyzing digital-phenotyping data by addressing the time-related decisions faced by researchers. For illustrative purposes, we use data from 10 students whose behavior (e.g., GPS, app usage) was recorded for 28 days through the Behapp application on their mobile phones. In parallel, the participants actively answered questionnaires on their phones about their mood several times a day. We provide a walk-through on how to study different timescales by doing individualized correlation analyses and random-forest prediction models. By doing so, we demonstrate how choosing different resolutions can lead to different conclusions. Therefore, we propose conducting a multiverse analysis to investigate the consequences of choosing different temporal resolutions. This will improve current standards for analyzing digital-phenotyping data and may help combat the replications crisis caused in part by researchers making implicit decisions.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Social interactions are essential for well-being. Therefore, researchers increasingly attempt to capture an individual’s social context to predict well-being, including mood. Different tools are used to measure various aspects of the social context. Digital phenotyping is a commonly used technology to assess a person’s social behavior objectively. The experience sampling method (ESM) can capture the subjective perception of specific interactions. Lastly, egocentric networks are often used to measure specific relationship characteristics. These different methods capture different aspects of the social context over different time scales that are related to well-being, and combining them may be necessary to improve the prediction of well-being. Yet, they have rarely been combined in previous research. To address this gap, our study investigates the predictive accuracy of mood based on the social context. We collected intensive within-person data from multiple passive and self-report sources over a 28–day period in a student sample (Participants: N = 11, ESM measures: N = 1313). We trained individualized random forest machine learning models, using different predictors included in each model summarized over different time scales. Our findings revealed that even when combining social interactions data using different methods, predictive accuracy of mood remained low. The average coefficient of determination over all participants was 0.06 for positive and negative affect and ranged from − 0.08 to 0.3, indicating a large amount of variance across people. Furthermore, the optimal set of predictors varied across participants; however, predicting mood using all predictors generally yielded the best predictions. While combining different predictors improved predictive accuracy of mood for most participants, our study highlights the need for further work using larger and more diverse samples to enhance the clinical utility of these predictive modeling approaches.</p>

<p>People’s networks are considered key in explaining fertility outcomes—whether people want and have children. Existing research on social influences on fertility is limited because data often come from small networks or highly selective samples, only few network variables are considered, and the strength of network effects is not properly assessed. We use data from a representative sample of Dutch women reporting on over 18 000 relationships. A data-driven approach including many network characteristics accounted for 0 to 40% of the out-of-sample variation in different outcomes related to fertility preferences. Individual characteristics were more important for all outcomes than network variables. Network composition was also important, particularly those people in the network desiring children or those choosing to be childfree. Structural network characteristics, which feature prominently in social influence theories and are based on the relations between people in the networks, hardly mattered. We discuss to what extent our results provide support for different mechanisms of social influence, and the advantages and disadvantages of our data-driven approach in comparison to traditional approaches.</p>
