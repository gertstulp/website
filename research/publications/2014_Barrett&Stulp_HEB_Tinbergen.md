title: "Four more reasons why ethology matters: Tinbergen and the human sciences"
description: |
  Tinbergen’s paper on aims and methods in ethology is, quite rightly, a citation classic. Here, we would like to emphasize that, 50 years after its initial publication, it continues to offer fresh insights into study of ethology – and human ethology in particular – as well as offering a valuable historical perspective on the biology of behavior more generally. Everyone, we think, can benefit from (re)reading Tinbergen (1963).

## Abstract

Tinbergen’s paper on aims and methods in ethology is, quite rightly, a citation classic. Here, we would like to emphasize that, 50 years after its initial publication, it continues to offer fresh insights into study of ethology – and human ethology in particular – as well as offering a valuable historical perspective on the biology of behavior more generally. Everyone, we think, can benefit from (re)reading Tinbergen (1963).
