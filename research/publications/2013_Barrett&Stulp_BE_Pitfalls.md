## Abstract

We know it’s incredibly tedious, but we have to admit we agree with everything Nettle et al. (2013) say. Not only is that tedious, it also makes for a rather brief commentary. So, in an effort to keep the conversation lively, we would like to address some additional issues that highlight the pleasures and pitfalls of studying humans from a behavioral ecological perspective.
