title: "Studying the number of children people want and have"
description: |
  There is huge variation in the number of children people (would like to) have over time / across the globe / within countries. I try to study the determinants of this variation, including individual factors like wealth and education, genetic factors, and social influences.

I should still write something more sensible here. For now:

#### In medicine:

- _fertility_ - the ability to conceive children
- _fecundity_ - the ability to produce an abundance of offspring

#### In demography:

- _fertility_ - the number of live births of babies to a female
- _fecundity_ - the physiological ability to have children
