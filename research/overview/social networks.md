Humans are uniquely social, being influenced by the ideas and behaviours of others even to their own detriment. Thus, people's social networks are essential in their behaviour. Yet, collecting and analysing such network is not trivial. 

## The Social Networks and Fertility study

Using specifically designed software to capture people's personal network during an online survey, I have managed to collect data on large personal networks on a representative sample of Dutch women via the LISS panel. Related work:

## How to best capture the social environment
Both Anna Langener and Marie Stadel work on how to best capture and analyse the social environment (including through personal network data collection, Experience Sampling Method data, and Digital Phenotyping data). Related work:
