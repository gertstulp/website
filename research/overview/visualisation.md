title: "Visualisation in research"
description: |
  Visualisation is key in any project involving datapoints. Yet the reader is not 'showered in graphical displays' [Anscombe, 1973]. I am an active promotor of the use of visualisation, and try to help people make graphs in several ways: i) by making the graphs for them; ii) by giving visualisation-workshops in R; iii) by creating R-packages that facilitate the use of graphs.

Visualisation is perhaps the easiest way to get good insights into the data at hand; whether for yourself or for the scrutinty of others. Disappointingly, most graphs in scientific papers do not attempt to show the (raw) data, but instead some summary measures (e.g., a bar plot of means). This hinders the scientific process. I hope to increase visualisation literacy, by:

- Helping others to think about graphs and to create them using ggplot2. I'll happily do this for **you** too. 
- Giving visualisation workshops; for instance, [this](http://stulp.gmw.rug.nl/ggplotworkshop/) one, and [a shorter version](http://stulp.gmw.rug.nl/yag/ggplotworkshop/)
- Creating **R**-packages that help people visualise, including [ggplotgui](https://github.com/gertstulp/ggplotgui) and [ESMvis](https://github.com/gertstulp/ESMvis) [_under development_; together with Laura Bringmann].
