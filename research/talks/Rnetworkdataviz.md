title: "Network Data Visualization in R"
description: |
  This workshop focuses on producing network-visualisation in R. We will use the packages, {ggplot2}, {tidygraph}, and {ggiraph} to create many different types of visualisations of both socio-centric and ego-centric networks. No previous experience with R is required. Bringing your own data to the workshop will help learning!
